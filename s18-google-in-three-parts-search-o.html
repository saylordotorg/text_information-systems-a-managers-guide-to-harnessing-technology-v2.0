Li, “Why Google’s One-Trick Pony Struggles to Learn New Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Publishing</em>, May 2009.</span> but as tricks go, it’s got an exquisite one. Google’s “trick” is matchmaking—pairing Internet surfers with advertisers and taking a cut along the way. This cut is substantial—about $29 billion in 2010. In fact, as <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>’s Steve Levy puts it, Google’s matchmaking capabilities may represent “the most successful business idea in history.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_002">S. Levy, “The Secrets of Googlenomics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 2009.</span> For perspective, consider that as a ten-year-old firm, and one that had been public for less than five years, Google had already grown to earn more annual advertising dollars than <em class="emphasis">any</em> U.S. media company. No television network, no magazine group, no newspaper chain brings in more ad bucks than Google. And none is more profitable. While Google’s stated mission is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” advertising drives profits and lets the firm offer most of its services for free.</p>

Not bad for a business started by two twenty-something computer science graduate students.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111010-134035-817369">While the bulk of the firm’s revenues come from advertising, the firm is now clearly engaged in a wide-ranging multi-front war that includes mobile, browsers, cloud infrastructure, email, office apps, social media, maps, tablets, television, video, and more. And while the firm’s performance in each space varies, the success of its existing businesses provides a massive cash horde that allows the firm to fuel experimentation, constantly innovate, tolerate failure, acquire aggressively, and patiently build new markets.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p05">Brin and Page have built a talent magnet.

The Googleplex is also pretty green. The facility gets 30 percent of its energy from solar cells, representing the largest corporate installation of its kind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_008">D. Weldon, “Google’s Power Play,” <em class="emphasis">EnergyDigital</em>, August 30, 2007.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p06">The firm’s quirky tech-centric culture is evident everywhere. A T-Rex skeleton looms near the volleyball court. Hanging from the lobby ceiling is a replica of SpaceShipOne, the first commercial space vehicle. And visitors to the bathroom will find “testing on the toilet,” coding problems or other brainteasers to keep gray matter humming while seated on one of the firm’s $800 remote-controlled Japanese commodes. Staff also enjoy an A-list lecture series attracting luminaries ranging from celebrities to heads of state.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p07">And of course there’s the food—all of it free. The firm’s founders felt that no employee should be more than 100 feet away from nourishment, and a tour around Google offices will find espresso bars, snack nooks, and fully stocked beverage refrigerators galore. There are eleven gourmet cafeterias on-site, the most famous being “Charlie’s Place,” first run by the former executive chef for the Grateful Dead.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p08">Chairman and former CEO Eric Schmidt said the goal of all this is “to strip away everything that gets in our employees’ way.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_009">L. Wolgemuth, “Forget the Recession, I Want a Better Chair,” <em class="emphasis">U.S. News and World Report</em>, April 28, 2008.</span> And the perks, culture, and sense of mission have allowed the firm to assemble one of the most impressive rosters of technical talent anywhere. The Googleplex is like a well-fed Manhattan project, and employee ranks have included a gaggle of geniuses that helped invent critical technologies such as the Macintosh user interface, the python programming language, the XML standard, and even the protocols that underlie the Internet itself.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p09">Engineers find Google a particularly attractive place to work, in part due to a corporate policy of offering “20 percent time,” the ability to work the equivalent of one day a week on new projects that interest them. It’s a policy that has fueled innovation. Google Vice President Marissa Mayer (who herself regularly ranks among <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s most powerful women in business) has stated that roughly half of Google products got their start in 20 percent time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_010">B.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p02">Before diving into how the firm makes money, let’s first understand how Google’s core service, search, works.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p03">Perform a search (or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">query</a><span class="glossdef">Search.</span></span>) on Google or another search engine, and the results you’ll see are referred to by industry professionals as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organic or natural search</a><span class="glossdef">Search engine results returned and ranked according to relevance.</span></span>. Search engines use different algorithms for determining the order of organic search results, but at Google the method is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">PageRank</a><span class="glossdef">Algorithm developed by Google cofounder Larry Page to rank Web sites.</span></span> (a bit of a play on words, it ranks Web pages, and was initially developed by Google cofounder Larry Page). Google does not accept money for placement of links in organic search results. Instead, PageRank results are a kind of popularity contest. Web pages that have more pages <em class="emphasis">linking to them</em> are ranked higher.</p>

        <p class="para">The query for “Toyota Prius” triggers organic search results, flanked top and right by advertisements.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p04">The process of improving a page’s organic search results is often referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine optimization (SEO)</a><span class="glossdef">The process of improving a page’s organic search results.</span></span>. SEO has become a critical function for many marketing organizations since if a firm’s pages aren’t near the top of search results, customers may never discover its site.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p05">Google is a bit vague about the specifics of precisely how PageRank has been refined, in part because many have tried to game the system. In addition to in-bound links, Google’s organic search results also consider some two hundred other signals, and the firm’s search quality team is relentlessly analyzing user behavior for clues on how to tweak the system to improve accuracy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_011">S. Levy, “Inside the Box,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, March 2010.</span> The less scrupulous have tried creating a series of bogus Web sites, all linking back to the pages they’re trying to promote (this is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">link fraud</a><span class="glossdef">Also called “spamdexing” or “link farming.” The process of creating a series of bogus Web sites, all linking back to the pages one is trying to promote.</span></span>, and Google actively works to uncover and shut down such efforts—see the “Link Fraudsters” sidebar).</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_n48">
        <h3 class="title">Link Fraudsters, Be Prepared to Experience Google’s “Death Penalty”</h3>
        <p class="para">JCPenney is a big retailer, for sure, but not necessarily the first firm to come to mind when you think of most retail categories. So the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> suspected that something fishy was up when the retailer’s site came out tops for dozens of Google searches, including the phrases “skinny jeans,” “dresses,” “bedding,” “area rugs,” “home decor,” “comforter sets,” “furniture,” and “table cloths”. The phrase “Samsonite carry on luggage” even placed Penney ahead of Samsonite’s own site!</p>
        <p class="para">The <em class="emphasis">Times</em> reported that “someone paid to have thousands of links placed on hundreds of sites scattered around the Web, all of which lead directly to JCPenney.com.” And there was little question it was blatant link fraud. Phrases related to dresses and linking back to the retailer were coming from such nondress sites as nuclear.engineeringaddict.com, casino-focus.com, and bulgariapropertyportal.com. One SEO expert called the effort the most ambitious link farming attempt he’d ever seen.</p>
        <p class="para">Link fraud undercuts the credibility of Google’s core search product, so when the search giant discovers a firm engaged in link farming they drop the hammer. In this case Google both manually demoted Penney rankings and launched tweaks to its ranking algorithm. Within two hours JCPenney organic results plummeted, in some cases from first to seventy-first (the <em class="emphasis">Times</em> calls this the organic search equivalent of the “death penalty”). Getting a top spot in Google search results is a big deal. On average, 34 percent of clicks go to the top result, about twice the percentage that goes to number two. Google’s punishment was administered despite the fact that Penney was also a large online ad customer, at times paying Google some $2.5 million a month for ads.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_081">D. Segal, “The Dirty Little Secrets of Search,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 12, 2011.</span></p>
        <p class="para">Google is constantly playing defense against firms gaming organic search results. In another example a Brooklyn-based eyewear firm allegedly mistreated customers in order to get more ranking-influencing links (albeit from negative mentions) from service review sites. For a time these associated with bad ratings actually pushed the eyewear firm’s search results <em class="emphasis">ahead</em> of rivals, and since users typically focus on the top ranking, many customers went to the firm without seeing the bad reviews (Google has since changed search results to make it difficult to benefit from cultivating negative reviews). The owner of the busted eyewear retailer has also pled guilty to multiple counts, including sending threatening communications, one count of mail fraud, and one count of wire fraud.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_082">D. Segal, “Online Seller Who Bullied Customers Pleads Guilty,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 12, 2011.</span></p>
        <p class="para">JCPenney isn’t the first firm busted. When Google discovered so-called black hat SEO was being used to push BMW up in organic search rankings, Google made certain BMW sites virtually unfindable in its organic search results. JCPenney claims that they were the victim of rogue behavior by an SEO consultant (who was promptly fired) and that the retailer was otherwise unaware of the unethical behavior. But it is surprising that the retailer’s internal team didn’t see their unbelievably successful organic search results as a red flag that something was amiss, and this case highlights the types of things managers need to watch for in the digital age. Penney outsourced SEO, and the fraud uncovered in this story underscores the critical importance of vetting and regularly auditing the performance of partners throughout a firm’s supply chain.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_083">D. Segal, “The Dirty Little Secrets of Search,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 12, 2011.</span></p>

    <p class="para block">While Google doesn’t divulge specifics on the weighting of inbound links from a given Web site, we do know that links from some Web sites carry more weight than others. For example, links from Web sites that Google deems “influential” have greater weight in PageRank calculations than links from run-of-the-mill sites.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Spiders and Bots and Crawlers—Oh My!</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p06">When performing a search via Google or another search engine, you’re not actually searching the Web. What really happens is that the major search engines make what amounts to a <em class="emphasis">copy</em> of the Web, storing and indexing the text of online documents on their own computers. Google’s index considers over one trillion URLs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_012">A. Wright, “Exploring a ‘Deep Web’ That Google Can’t Grasp,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 23, 2009.</span> Google starts to retrieve results as soon as you begin to type, and the upper right-hand corner of a Google query shows you just how fast a search can take place.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p07">To create these massive indexes, search firms use software to crawl the Web and uncover as much information as they can find. This software is referred to by several different names—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spiders, Web crawlers, software robots</a><span class="glossdef">Software that traverses available Web links in an attempt to perform a given task. Search engines use spiders to discover documents for indexing and retrieval.</span></span>—but they all pretty much work the same way. The spiders ask each public computer network for a list of its public Web sites (for more on this see DNS in <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch14#fwk-38086-ch14" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 12 "A Manager’s Guide to the Internet and Telecommunications"</a>). Then the spiders go through this list (“crawling” a site), following every available link until all pages are uncovered.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p08">Google will crawl frequently updated sites, like those run by news organizations, as often as several times an hour. Rarely updated, less popular sites might only be reindexed every few days. The method used to crawl the Web also means that if a Web site isn’t the first page on a public server, or isn’t linked to from another public page, then it’ll never be found.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_013">Most Web sites do have a link where you can submit a Web site for indexing, and doing so can help promote the discovery of your content.</span> Also note that each search engine also offers a page where you can submit your Web site for indexing.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p09">While search engines show you what they’ve found on their <em class="emphasis">copy</em> of the Web’s contents; clicking a search result will direct you to the actual Web site, not the copy. But sometimes you’ll click a result only to find that the Web site doesn’t match what the search engine found. This happens if a Web site was updated before your search engine had a chance to reindex the changes. In most cases you can still pull up the search engine’s copy of the page. Just click the “Cached” link below the result (the term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cache</a><span class="glossdef">A temporary storage space used to speed computing tasks.</span></span> refers to a temporary storage space used to speed computing tasks).</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p10">But what if you want the content on your Web site to remain off limits to search engine indexing and caching? Organizations have created a set of standards to stop the spider crawl, and all commercial search engines have agreed to respect these standards. One way is to put a line of <em class="emphasis">HTML code</em> invisibly embedded in a Web page that tells all software robots to stop indexing a page, stop following links on the page, or stop offering old page archives in a cache. Users don’t see this code, but commercial Web crawlers do. For those familiar with HTML code (the language used to describe a Web site), the command to stop Web crawlers from indexing a page, following links, and listing archives of cached pages looks like this:</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p11">〈META NAME=“ROBOTS” CONTENT=“NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOARCHIVE”〉</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p12">There are other techniques to keep the spiders out, too. Web site administrators can add a special file (called robots.txt) that provides similar instructions on how indexing software should treat the Web site. And a lot of content lies inside the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dark Web</a><span class="glossdef">Internet content that can’t be indexed by Google and other search engines.</span></span>,” either behind corporate firewalls or inaccessible to those without a user account—think of private Facebook updates no one can see unless they’re your friend—all of that is out of Google’s reach.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p14">The size of this investment not only creates a barrier to entry, it influences industry profitability, with market-leader Google enjoying huge economies of scale. Firms may spend the same amount to build server farms, but if Google has roughly two-thirds of this market while Microsoft’s search draws just a fraction of this traffic, which do you think enjoys the better return on investment?</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p15">The hardware components that power Google aren’t particularly special. In most cases the firm uses the kind of Intel or AMD processors, low-end hard drives, and RAM chips that you’d find in a desktop PC. These components are housed in rack-mounted servers about 3.5 inches thick, with each server containing two processors, eight memory slots, and two hard drives.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p16">In some cases, Google mounts racks of these servers inside standard-sized shipping containers, each with as many as 1,160 servers per box.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_018">S. Shankland, “Google Unlocks Once-Secret Server,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, April 1, 2009.</span> A given data center may have dozens of these server-filled containers all linked together. Redundancy is the name of the game. Google assumes individual components will regularly fail, but no single failure should interrupt the firm’s operations (making the setup what geeks call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fault-tolerant</a><span class="glossdef">Capable of continuing operation even if a component fails.</span></span>). If something breaks, a technician can easily swap it out with a replacement.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p17">Each server farm layout has also been carefully designed with an emphasis on lowering power consumption and cooling requirements. And the firm’s custom software (much of it built upon open source products) allows all this equipment to operate as the world’s largest grid computer.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_p18">Web search is a task particularly well suited for the massively parallel architecture used by Google and its rivals. For an analogy of how this works, imagine that working alone, you need try to find a particular phrase in a hundred-page document (that’s a one server effort). Next, imagine that you can distribute the task across five thousand people, giving each of them a separate sentence to scan (that’s the multi-server grid). This difference gives you a sense of how search firms use massive numbers of servers and the divide-and-conquer approach of grid computing to quickly find the needles you’re searching for within the Web’s haystack.

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s02_l02">
            <li>Ranked search results are often referred to as organic or natural search. PageRank is Google’s algorithm for ranking search results. PageRank orders organic search results based largely on the number of Web sites linking to them, and the “weight” of each page as measured by its “influence.”</li>
            <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of using natural or organic search to increase a Web site’s traffic volume and visitor quality. The scope and influence of search has made SEO an increasingly vital marketing function.</li>
            <li>Users don’t really search the Web; they search an archived copy built by crawling and indexing discoverable documents.</li>
            <li>Google operates from a massive network of server farms containing hundreds of thousands of servers built from standard, off-the-shelf items. The cost of the operation is a significant barrier to entry for competitors. Google’s share of search suggests the firm can realize economies of scales over rivals required to make similar investments while delivering fewer results (and hence ads).</li>
            <li>Web site owners can hide pages from popular search engine Web crawlers using a number of methods, including HTML tags, a no-index file, or ensuring that Web sites aren’t linked to other pages and haven’t been submitted to Web sites for indexing.</li>

            <li> How does Google rank search results? Investigate and list some methods that an organization might use to improve its rank in Google’s organic search results. Are there techniques Google might not approve of? What risk does a firm run if Google or another search firm determines that it has used unscrupulous SEO techniques to try to unfairly influence ranking algorithms? </li>

            <li> Some Web sites are accused of being “content farms,” offering low-quality content designed to attract searchers that include popular query terms and using this content to generate ad revenue. Demand Media, which went public at $1.5 billion, and Associated Content, which Yahoo! purchased for $100 million, have been accused of being content farms. Investigate the claims and visit these sites. Do you find the content useful? Do you think these sites are or are not content farms? Research how Google changed its ranking algorithm to penalize content farms. What has been the impact on these sites? Make a list of categories of firms and individuals that would likely be impacted by such moves. What does this tell you about Google’s influence? </li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s03_p02">For several years, Internet advertising has been the only major media ad category to show significant growth. There are three factors driving online ad growth trends: (1) increased user time online, (2) improved measurement and accountability, and (3) targeting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s03_p03">American teenagers (as well as the average British, Australian, and New Zealander Web surfer) now spend more time on the Internet than watching television.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_020">“American Teenagers Spend More Time Online Than Watching Television,” <em class="emphasis">MediaWeek</em>, June 19, 2008; A.

Tobias, “Newspapers under Siege,” <em class="emphasis">Philstar</em>, May 18, 2009.</span> So advertisers are simply following the market. Online channels also provide advertisers with a way to reach consumers at work—something that was previously much more difficult to do.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s03_p04">Many advertisers have also been frustrated by how difficult it’s been to gauge the effectiveness of traditional ad channels such as TV, print, and radio. This frustration is reflected in the old industry saying, “I know that half of my advertising is working—I just don’t know which half.” Well, with the Internet, now you know. While measurement technologies aren’t perfect, advertisers can now count ad <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impressions</a><span class="glossdef">Each time an ad is served to a user for viewing.</span></span> (the number of times an ad is shown on a Web site), whether a user clicks on an ad, and the product purchases or other Web site activity that comes from those clicks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_022">For a more detailed overview of the limitations in online ad measurement, see L. Rao, “Guess Which Brand Is Now Worth $100 Billion?” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, April 30, 2009.</span> And as we’ll see, many online ad payment schemes are directly linked to ad performance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s03_p05">Various technologies and techniques also make it easier for firms to target users based on how likely a person is to respond to an ad. In theory a firm can use targeting to spend marketing dollars only on those users deemed to be its best prospects. Let’s look at a few of these approaches in action.</p>
    <div class="key_takeaways editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s03_n02">

            <li>There are three reasons driving online ad growth trends: (1) increasing user time online, (2) improved measurement and accountability, and (3) targeting.</li>
            <li>Digital media is decreasing time spent through traditional media consumption channels (e.g., radio, TV, newspapers), potentially lowering the audience reach of these old channels and making them less attractive for advertisers.</li>
            <li>Measurement techniques allow advertisers to track the performance of their ads—indicating things such as how often an ad is displayed, how often an ad is clicked, where an ad was displayed when it was clicked, and more. Measurement metrics can be linked to payment schemes, improving return on investment (ROI) and accountability compared to many types of conventional advertising.</li>
            <li>Advertising ROI can be improved through targeting. Targeting allows a firm to serve ads to specific categories of users, so firms can send ads to groups it is most interested in reaching, and those that are most likely to respond to an effort.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p03">Over two-thirds of Google’s revenues come from ads served on its own sites, and the vast majority of this revenue comes from search engine ads.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_024">Google, “Google Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Results,” press release, January 22, 2009.</span>  During Google’s early years, the firm actually resisted making money through ads. In fact, while at Stanford, Brin and Page even coauthored a paper titled “The Evils of Advertising.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_025">D. Vise, “Google’s Decade,” <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em>, September 12, 2008.</span>  But when Yahoo! and others balked at buying Google’s search technology (offered for as little as $500,000), Google needed to explore additional revenue streams. It wasn’t until two years after incorporation that Google ran ads alongside organic search results. That first ad, one for “Live Mail Order Lobsters,” appeared just minutes after the firm posted a link reading “See Your Ad Here”.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_026">S. Levy, “The Secrets of Googlenomics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 2009.</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p04">Google has only recently experimented with incorporating video and image ads into search, but for the most part, the ads you’ll see to the right (and sometimes top) of Google’s organic search results are text ads. These ads are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">keyword advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Advertisements that are targeted based on a user’s query.</span></span>, meaning they’re targeted based on the words in a user’s search query. Advertisers bid on the keywords and phrases that they’d like to use to trigger the display of their ad. Linking ads to search was a brilliant move, since the user’s search term indicates an overt interest in a given topic. Want to sell hotel stays in Tahiti? Link your ads to the search term “Tahiti Vacation.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p05">Not only are search ads highly targeted, advertisers only pay for results.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p06">Google didn’t invent pay-for-performance search advertising. A firm named GoTo.com (later renamed Overture) pioneered pay-per-click ads and bidding systems and held several key patents governing the technology. Overture provided pay-per-click ad services to both Yahoo! and Microsoft, but it failed to refine and match the killer combination of ad auctions and search technology that made Google a star. Yahoo! eventually bought Overture and sued Google for patent infringement. In 2004, the two firms settled, with Google giving Yahoo! 2.7 million shares in exchange for a “fully paid, perpetual license” to over sixty Overture patents.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_027">S.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p07">If an advertiser wants to display an ad on Google search, they can set up a Google AdWords advertising account in minutes, specifying just a single ad, or multiple ad campaigns that trigger different ads for different keywords. Advertisers also specify what they’re willing to pay each time an ad is clicked, how much their overall ad budget is, and they can control additional parameters, such as the timing and duration of an ad campaign.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p08">If no one clicks on an ad, Google doesn’t make money, advertisers don’t attract customers, and searchers aren’t seeing ads they’re interested in. So in order to create a winning scenario for everyone, Google has developed a precise ad ranking formula that rewards top performing ads by considering two metrics: the maximum CPC that an advertiser is willing to pay, and the advertisement’s quality score—a broad measure of ad performance. Create high quality ads and your advertisements might appear ahead of competition, even if your competitors bid more than you. But if ads perform poorly they’ll fall in rankings or even drop from display consideration.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p09">Below is the formula used by Google to determine the rank order of sponsored links appearing on search results pages.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p10">One factor that goes into determining an ad’s quality score is the <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_5b"><a class="glossterm">click-through rate (CTR)</a><span class="glossdef">The number of users who clicked an ad divided by the number of times the ad was delivered (the impressions).

The CTR measures the percentage of people who clicked on an ad to arrive at a destination-site. Also included in a quality score are the overall history of click performance for the keywords linked to the ad, the relevance of an ad’s text to the user’s query, and Google’s automated assessment of the user experience on the <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_6"><a class="glossterm">landing page</a><span class="glossdef">The Web page displayed when a user clicks on an advertisement.</span></span>—the Web page displayed when a user clicks on the ad. Ads that don’t get many clicks, ad descriptions that have nothing to do with query terms, and ads that direct users to generic pages that load slowly or aren’t strongly related to the keywords and descriptions used in an ad will all lower an ad’s chance of being displayed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_028">Google, <em class="emphasis">Marketing and Advertising Using Google: Targeting Your Advertising to the Right Audience</em> (Boston: Cengage Learning, 2007).</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_p11">When an ad is clicked, advertisers don’t actually pay their maximum CPC; Google discounts ads to just one cent more than the minimum necessary to maintain an ad’s position on the page. So if you bid one dollar per click, but the ad ranked below you bids ninety cents, you’ll pay just ninety-one cents if the ad is clicked. Discounting was a brilliant move. No one wants to get caught excessively overbidding rivals, so discounting helps reduce the possibility of this so-called bidder’s remorse. And with this risk minimized, the system actually encouraged higher bids!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_029">S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Geotargeting</a><span class="glossdef">Identifying a user’s physical location (sometimes called geolocation) for the purpose of delivering tailored ads or other content.</span></span> occurs when computer systems identify a user’s physical location (sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">geolocation</em>) for the purpose of delivering tailored ads or other content. On Google AdWords, for example, advertisers can specify that their ads only appear for Web surfers located in a particular country, state, metropolitan region, or a given distance around a precise locale. They can even draw a custom ad-targeting region on a map and tell Google to only show ads to users detected inside that space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_s02_p02">Ads in Google Search are geotargeted based on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">IP address</a><span class="glossdef">A value used to identify a device that is connected to the Internet. IP addresses are usually expressed as four numbers (from 0 to 255), separated by periods.</span></span>. Every device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address assigned by the organization connecting the device to the network. Normally you don’t see your IP address (a set of four numbers, from 0 to 255, separated by periods; e.g., 136.167.2.220). But the range of IP addresses “owned” by major organizations and Internet service providers (ISPs) is public knowledge. In many cases it’s possible to make an accurate guess as to where a computer, laptop, or mobile phone is located simply by cross-referencing a device’s current IP address with this public list.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_s02_p03">For example, it’s known that all devices connected to the Boston College network contain IP addresses starting with the numbers 136.167. If a search engine detects a query coming from an IP address that begins with those two numbers, it can be fairly certain that the person using that device is in the greater Boston area.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_s02_p04">IP addresses will change depending on how and where you connect to the Internet. Connect your laptop to a hotel’s Wi-Fi when visiting a new city, and you’re likely to see ads specific to that location. That’s because your Internet service provider has changed, and the firm serving your ads has detected that you are using an IP address known to be associated with your new location.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s04_s02_p05">Geotargeting via IP address is fairly accurate, but it’s not perfect. For example, some Internet service providers may provide imprecise or inaccurate information on the location of their networks. Others might be so vague that it’s difficult to make a best guess at the geography behind a set of numbers (values assigned by a multinational corporation with many locations, for example).

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s05_p08">To combat embarrassment, ad networks provide opportunities for both advertisers and content providers to screen out potentially undesirable pairings based on factors like vendor, Web site, and category. Advertisers can also use negative keywords, which tell networks to avoid showing ads when specific words appear (e.g., setting negative keywords to “murder” or “killer” could have spared luggage advertisers from the embarrassing problem mentioned above). Ad networks also refine ad-placement software based on feedback from prior incidents (for more on content adjacency problems, see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch07#fwk-38086-ch07" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 8 "Facebook: Building a Business from the Social Graph"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s05_p09">Google launched AdSense in 2003, but Google is by no means the only company to run an ad network nor was it the first to come up with the idea. Rivals include the Yahoo! Publisher Network, Microsoft’s adCenter, AdBrite, and AOL Advertising. Advertisers also aren’t limited to choosing just one ad network. In fact, many content provider Web sites will serve ads from several ad networks (as well as exclusive space sold by their own sales force), oftentimes mixing several different offerings on the same page.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ad Networks and Competitive Advantage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s05_s01_p01">While advertisers can use multiple ad networks, there are several key strategic factors driving the industry. For Google, its ad network is a distribution play. The ability to reach more potential customers across more Web sites attracts more advertisers to Google. And content providers (the Web sites that distribute these ads) want there to be as many advertisers as possible in the ad networks that they join, since this should increase the price of advertising, the number of ads served, and the accuracy of user targeting. If advertisers attract content providers, which in turn attract more advertisers, then we’ve just described network effects! More participants bringing in more revenue also help the firm benefit from scale economies—offering a better return on investment from its ad technology and infrastructure. No wonder Google’s been on such a tear—the firm’s loaded with assets for competitive advantage!</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p02">Online ads aren’t just about text ads billed in CPC. Ads running through Google AdSense, through its DoubleClick subsidiary, or on most competitor networks can be displayed in several formats and media types, and can be billed in different ways. The specific ad formats supported depend on the ad network but can include the following: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">image (or display) ads</a><span class="glossdef">Graphical advertising (as opposed to text ads).</span></span> (such as horizontally oriented banners, smaller rectangular buttons, and vertically oriented “skyscraper” ads); <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rich media ads</a><span class="glossdef">Online ads that include animation, audio, or video.</span></span> (which can include animation or video); and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interstitials</a><span class="glossdef">Ads that run before a user arrives at a Web site’s contents.</span></span> (ads that run before a user arrives at a Web site’s contents).

The IAB evaluates and recommends interactive advertising standards and practices and also conducts research, education, and legislative lobbying.</span></span> sets common standards for display ads so that a single creative (the design and content of the advertisement) can run unmodified across multiple ad networks and Web sites.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_036">See Interactive Advertising Bureau Ad Unit Guidelines for details at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452">http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p03">And there are lots of other ways ads are sold besides cost-per-click. Most graphical display ads are sold according to the number of times the ad appears (the <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_5c"><a class="glossterm">impression</a><span class="glossdef">Each time an advertisement is displayed.</span></span>). Ad rates are quoted in <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_6a"><a class="glossterm">CPM</a><span class="glossdef">Cost per thousand impressions (the M representing the roman numeral for one thousand).</span></span>, meaning cost per thousand impressions (the M representing the roman numeral for one thousand). Display ads sold on a CPM basis are often used as part of branding campaigns targeted more at creating awareness than generating click-throughs. Such techniques often work best for promoting products like soft drinks, toothpaste, or movies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cost-per-action (CPA)</a><span class="glossdef">A method of charging for advertising whenever a user performs a specified action such as signing up for a service, requesting material, or making a purchase.</span></span> ads pay whenever a user clicks through and performs a specified action such as signing up for a service, requesting material, or making a purchase. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Affiliate programs</a><span class="glossdef">A cost-per-action program, where program sponsors (e.g., Amazon.com, iTunes) pay referring Web sites a percentage of revenue earned from the referral.</span></span> are a form of cost-per-action, where vendors share a percentage of revenue with Web sites that direct purchasing customers to their online storefronts. Amazon runs the world’s largest affiliate program, and referring sites can earn 4 percent to 15 percent of sales generated from these click-throughs. Purists might not consider affiliate programs as advertising (rather than text or banner ads, Amazon’s affiliates offer links and product descriptions that point back to Amazon’s Web site), but these programs can be important tools in a firm’s promotional arsenal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p05">And rather than buying targeted ads, a firm might sometimes opt to become an exclusive advertiser on a site. For example, a firm could buy access to all ads served on a site’s main page; it could secure exclusive access to a region of the page (such as the topmost banner ad); or it may pay to sponsor a particular portion or activity on a Web site (say a parenting forum, or a “click-to-print” button). Such deals can be billed based on a flat rate, CPM, CPC, or any combination of metrics.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ads in Games?</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p06">As consumers spend more time in video games, it’s only natural that these products become ad channels, too. Finding a way to introduce ads without eroding the game experience can be a challenge. Advertising can work in racing or other sports games (in 2008 the Obama campaign famously ran virtual billboards in EA’s Burnout Paradise), but ads make less sense for games set in the past, future, or on other worlds. Branding ads often work best since click-throughs are typically not something you want disrupting your gaming experience.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p07">Advertisers have also explored sponsorships of Web-based and mobile games. Sponsorships often work best with casual games, such as those offered on Yahoo! Games or EA’s Pogo. Firms have also created online mini games (so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advergames</a><span class="glossdef"></span></span>) for longer term, immersive brand engagement (e.g., Mini Cooper’s Slide Parking and Stride Gum’s Chew Challenge). Others have tried a sort of virtual product placement integrated into experiences. A version of The Sims, for example, included virtual replicas of real-world inventory from IKEA and H&amp;M. And Zynga has done a variety of in-game promotions that include work with Lady Gaga in Farmville and CityVille promotions of Kung Fu Panda 2.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p08">In-game ad-serving technology also lacks the widely accepted standards of Web-based ads, so it’s unlikely that ads designed for a Wii sports game could translate into a PS3 first-person shooter.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p09">In-game advertising shows promise, but the medium is considerably more complicated than conventional Web site ads. That complexity lowers relative ROI and will likely continue to constrain growth.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p02">Advertisers are willing to pay more for ads that have a greater chance of reaching their target audience, and online firms have a number of targeting tools at their disposal. Much of this targeting occurs whenever you visit a Web site, where a behind-the-scenes software dialogue takes place between Web browser and Web server that can reveal a number of pieces of information, including IP address, the type of browser used, the computer type, its operating system, and unique identifiers, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cookies</a><span class="glossdef">A line of identifying text, assigned and retrieved by a given Web server and stored by your browser.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p03">And remember, <em class="emphasis">any</em> server that serves you content can leverage these profiling technologies. You might be profiled not just by the Web site that you’re visiting (e.g., nytimes.com), but also by any ad networks that serve ads on that site (e.g., Platform-A, DoubleClick, Google AdSense, Microsoft adCenter).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p04">IP addresses are leveraged extensively in customer profiling. An IP address not only helps with geolocation, it can also indicate a browser’s employer or university, which can be further matched with information such as firm size or industry. IBM has used IP targeting to tailor its college recruiting banner ads to specific schools, for example, “There Is Life After Boston College, Click Here to See Why.” That campaign garnered click-through rates ranging from 5 to 30 percent<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_037">M. Moss, “These Web Sites Know Who You Are,” <em class="emphasis">ZDNet UK</em>, October 13, 1999.</span> compared to average rates that are currently well below 1 percent for untargeted banner ads. DoubleClick once even served a banner that included a personal message for an executive at then-client Modem Media. The ad, reading “Congratulations on the twins, John Nardone,” was served across hundreds of sites, but was only visible from computers that accessed the Internet from the Modem Media corporate network.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_038">M.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p05">The ability to identify a surfer’s computer, browser, or operating system can also be used to target tech ads. For example, Google might pitch its Chrome browser to users detected running Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari; while Apple could target Mac ads just to Windows users.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p06">But perhaps the greatest degree of personalization and targeting comes from cookies. Visit a Web site for the first time, and in most cases, a dialogue between server and browser takes place that goes something like this:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p07">Server: <em class="emphasis">Have I seen you before?</em></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p08">Browser: <em class="emphasis">No.</em></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p09">Server: <em class="emphasis">Then take this unique string of numbers and letters (called a cookie). I’ll use it to recognize you from now on.</em></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p10">The cookie is just a line of identifying text assigned and retrieved by a given Web server and stored on your computer by your browser. Upon accepting this cookie your browser has been tagged, like an animal. As you surf around the firm’s Web site, that cookie can be used to build a profile associated with your activities. If you’re on a portal like Yahoo! you might type in your zip code, enter stocks that you’d like to track, and identify the sports teams you’d like to see scores for. The next time you return to the Web site, your browser responds to the server’s “<em class="emphasis">Have I see you before?</em>” question with the equivalent of “<em class="emphasis">Yes, you know me;</em>,” and it presents the cookie that the site gave you earlier.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p11">Cookies are used for lots of purposes. Retail Web sites like Amazon use cookies to pay attention to what you’ve shopped for and bought, tailoring Web sites to display products that the firm suspects you’ll be most interested in.

Of course, if you block cookies, you block any benefits that come along with them, and some Web site features may require cookies to work properly. Also note that while deleting a cookie breaks a link between your browser and that Web site, if you supply identifying information in the future (say by logging into an old profile), the site might be able to assign your old profile data to the new cookie.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s07_p15">While the Internet offers targeting technologies that go way beyond traditional television, print, and radio offerings, none of these techniques is perfect. Since users are regularly assigned different IP addresses as they connect and disconnect from various physical and Wi-Fi networks, IP targeting can’t reliably identify individual users. Cookies also have their weaknesses. They’re assigned by browsers and associated with a given user’s account on that computer. That means that if several people use the same browser on the same computer without logging on to that machine as separate users, then all their Web surfing activity may be mixed into the same cookie profile. (One solution is to create different log-in accounts on that computer. Your PC will then keep separate cookies for each account.) Some users might also use different browsers on the same machine or use different computers. Unless a firm has a way to match up these different cookies assigned across browsers (say by linking cookies on separate machines to a single log-in used at multiple locations), then a site may be working with multiple, incomplete profiles.</p>

            <li>The communication between Web browser and Web server can identify IP address, the type of browser used, the computer type, its operating system, time and date of access, and duration of Web page visit, and can read and assign unique identifiers, called cookies—all of which can be used in customer profiling and ad targeting.</li>
            <li>An IP address not only helps with geolocation; it can also be matched against other databases to identify the organization providing the user with Internet access (such as a firm or university), that organization’s industry, size, and related statistics.</li>
            <li>A cookie is a unique line of identifying text, assigned and retrieved by a given Web server and stored on a computer by the browser, that can be used to build a profile associated with your Web activities.</li>
            <li>The most popular Web browsers allow you to block all cookies, block just third-party cookies, purge your cookie file, or even ask for your approval before accepting a cookie.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p02">While AdSense has been wildly successful, contextual advertising has its limits. For example, what kind of useful targeting can firms really do based on the text of a news item on North Korean nuclear testing?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_039">R. Singel, “Online Behavioral Targeting Targeted by Feds, Critics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired News</em>, June 3, 2009.</span> So in March 2009, Google announced what it calls “interest-based ads.” Google AdSense would now issue a third-party cookie and would track browsing activity across AdSense partner sites, and Google-owned YouTube (the firm had not previously used tracking cookies on its AdSense network). AdSense would build a profile, initially identifying users within thirty broad categories and six hundred subcategories. Says one Google project manager, “We’re looking to make ads even more interesting.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_040">R. Hof, “Behavioral Targeting: Google Pulls Out the Stops,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, March 11, 2009.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p03">Of course, there’s a financial incentive to do this too. Ads deemed more interesting should garner more clicks, meaning more potential customer leads for advertisers, more revenue for Web sites that run AdSense, and more money for Google.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p04">But while targeting can benefit Web surfers, users will resist if they feel that they are being mistreated, exploited, or put at risk. Negative backlash might also result in a change in legislation. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has already called for more transparency and user control in online advertising and for requesting user consent (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">opt-in</a><span class="glossdef">Program (typically a marketing effort) that requires customer consent. This program is contrasted with opt-out programs, which enroll all customers by default.</span></span>) when collecting sensitive data.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_041">R. Singel, “Online Behavioral Targeting Targeted by Feds, Critics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired News</em>, June 3, 2009.</span> Mishandled user privacy could curtail targeting opportunities, limiting growth across the online advertising field. And with less ad support, many of the Internet’s free services could suffer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p05">Google’s roll-out of interest-based ads shows the firm’s sensitivity to these issues. First, while major rivals have all linked query history to ad targeting, Google steadfastly refuses to do this. Other sites often link registration data (including user-submitted demographics such as gender and age) with tracking cookies, but Google avoids this practice as well.</p>

Hansell, “A Guide to Google’s New Privacy Controls,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 12, 2009.</span> Each interest-based ad is accompanied by an “Ads by Google” link that will bring users to a page describing Google advertising and which provides access to the company’s “Ads Preferences Manager.” This tool allows surfers to see any of the hundreds of potential categorizations that Google has assigned to that browser’s tracking cookie. Users can remove categorizations, and even add interests if they want to improve ad targeting. Some topics are too sensitive to track, and the technology avoids profiling race, religion, sexual orientation, health, political or trade union affiliation, and certain financial categories.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_043">R.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p08">Google’s moves are meant to demonstrate transparency in its ad targeting technology, and the firm’s policies may help raise the collective privacy bar for the industry. While privacy advocates have praised Google’s efforts to put more control in the hands of users, many continue to voice concern over what they see as the increasing amount of information that the firm houses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_044">M. Helft, “BITS; Google Lets Users See a Bit of Selves” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 9, 2009.</span> For an avid user, Google could conceivably be holding e-mail (Gmail), photos (Picasa), a Web surfing profile (AdSense and DoubleClick), medical records (Google Health), location (Google Latitude), appointments (Google Calendar), transcripts of phone messages (Google Voice), work files (Google Docs), and more.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p09">Google insists that reports portraying it as a data-hoarding Big Brother are inaccurate. The firm is adamant that user data exists in silos that aren’t federated (linked) in any way, nor are employees permitted access to multiple data archives without extensive clearance and monitoring. Data is not sold to third parties. Activities in Gmail, Docs, or most other services isn’t added to targeting profiles. And any targeting is fully disclosed, with users empowered to opt out at all levels.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_045">R. Mitchell, “What Google Knows about You,” <em class="emphasis">Computerworld</em>, May 11, 2009.</span> But critics counter that corporate intentions and data use policies (articulated in a Web site’s Terms of Service) can change over time, and that a firm’s good behavior today is no guarantee of good behavior in the future.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_046">R.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p10">Google does enjoy a lot of user goodwill, and it is widely recognized for its unofficial motto “Don’t Be Evil.” However, some worry that even though Google might not be evil, it could still make a mistake, and that despite its best intentions, a security breach or employee error could leave data dangerously or embarrassingly exposed.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p11">Gaffes have repeatedly occurred. A March 2009 system flaw inadvertently shared some Google Docs with contacts who were never granted access to them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_047">J. Kincaid, “Google Privacy Blunder Shares Your Docs without Permission,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, March 7, 2009.</span> When the firm introduced its Google Buzz social networking service in early 2010, many users were horrified that their most frequently used Gmail contacts were automatically added to Buzz, allowing others to see who you’re communicating with.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p12">Privacy advocates also worry that the amount of data stored by Google serves as one-stop shopping for litigators and government investigators.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p13">Google is increasingly finding itself in precedent-setting cases where the law is vague.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s08_p14">Ad targeting brings to a head issues of opportunity, privacy, security, risk, and legislation. Google is now taking a more active public relations and lobbying role to prevent misperceptions and to be sure its positions are understood. While the field continues to evolve, Google’s experience will lay the groundwork for the future of personalized technology and provide a case study for other firms that need to strike the right balance between utility and privacy. Despite differences, it seems clear to Google, its advocates, and its detractors that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Rank-based impression fraud</em>—on-sites where ad rank is based on click performance, fraudsters repeatedly search keywords linked to rival ads or access pages where rival ads appear.

But remember, each visitor is identified by an IP address, so lots of clicks from a single IP make the bad guys easy to spot.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p02">So organized crime tried to raise the bar, running so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click farms</a><span class="glossdef">Recruiting a network of users to engage in click fraud with the goal of spreading IP addresses across several systems and make a fraud effort more difficult to detect.</span></span> to spread fraud across dozens of IP addresses. <em class="emphasis">The Times of India</em> uncovered one such effort where Indian housewives were receiving up to twenty-five cents for each ad click made on fraudster-run Web sites.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_054">N.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p03">Fraudsters then moved on to use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">zombie networks</a><span class="glossdef">Sometimes called “clickbots” or “botnets,” these are hordes of surreptitiously infiltrated computers, linked and controlled remotely. This technique is used to perpetrate click fraud, as well as a variety of other computer security crimes.</span></span>—hordes of surreptitiously infiltrated computers, linked and controlled by rogue software.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_055">C. Mann, “How Click Fraud Could Swallow the Internet,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, January 2006.</span> To create zombie networks (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">botnets</em>), hackers exploit security holes, spread viruses, or use so-called phishing techniques to trick users into installing software that will lie dormant, awaiting commands from a central location. The controlling machine then sends out tasks for each zombie, instructing them to visit Web sites and click on ads in a way that mimics real traffic. Zombie botnets can be massive. Dutch authorities once took down a gang that controlled some 1.5 million machines.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_056">T. Sanders, “Dutch Botnet Gang Facing Jail,” <em class="emphasis">IT News Australia</em>, January 18, 2007; and N. Daswani and M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p04">Scary, but this is where scale, expertise, and experience come in. The more activity an ad network can monitor, the greater the chance that it can uncover patterns that are anomalous. Higher click-through rates than comparable sites? Caught. Too many visits to a new or obscure site? Caught. Clicks that don’t fit standard surfing patterns for geography, time, and day? Caught.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p05">Sometimes the goal isn’t theft, but sabotage. Google’s Ad Traffic Quality Team backtracked through unusual patterns to uncover a protest effort targeted at Japanese credit card firms. Ad clicks were eventually traced to an incendiary blogger who incited readers to search for the Japanese word <em class="emphasis">kiyashinku</em> (meaning cashing credit, or credit cards), and to click the credit card firm ads that show up, depleting firm search marketing budgets. Sneaky, but uncovered and shut down, without harm to the advertisers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_057">M. Jakobsson and Z.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p06">Search firm and ad network software can use data patterns and other signals to ferret out most other types of fraud, too, including rank-based impression fraud, spamdexing, and keyword stuffing. While many have tried to up the stakes with increasingly sophisticated attacks, large ad networks have worked to match them, increasing their anomaly detection capabilities across all types of fraud.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_058">M. Jakobsson and Z. Ramzan, <em class="emphasis">Crimeware: Understanding New Attacks and Defenses</em> (Cupertino, CA: Symantec Press, 2008).</span> Here we see another scale and data-based advantage for Google. Since the firm serves more search results and advertisements than its rivals do, it has vastly more information on online activity. And if it knows more about what’s happening online than any other firm, it’s likely to be first to shut down anyone who tries to take advantage of the system.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Click Fraud: How Bad Is It?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p07">Accounts on the actual rate of click fraud vary widely. Some third-party firms contend that nearly one in five clicks is fraudulent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_059">S. Hamner, “Pay-per-Click Advertisers Combat Costly Fraud,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 12, 2009.</span> But Google adamantly disputes these headline-grabbing numbers, claiming that many such reports are based on-site logs that reflect false data from conditions that Google doesn’t charge for (e.g., double counting a double click, or adding up repeated use of the browser back button in a way that looks like multiple clicks have occurred). The firm also offers monitoring, analytics, and reporting tools that can uncover this kind of misperceived discrepancy.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p08">Google contends that all invalid clicks (mistakes and fraud) represent less than 10 percent of all clicks, that the vast majority of these clicks are filtered out, and that Google doesn’t charge advertisers for clicks flagged as mistakes or suspicious.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_060">M. Lafsky, “Google and Click Fraud: Behind the Numbers,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 27, 2008.</span> In fact, Google says their screening bar is so high and so accurate that less than 0.02 percent of clicks are reactively classified as invalid and credited back to advertisers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_061">M. Jakobsson and Z. Ramzan, <em class="emphasis">Crimeware: Understanding New Attacks and Defenses</em> (Cupertino, CA: Symantec Press, 2008).</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s09_s01_p09">So who’s right? While it’s impossible to identify the intention behind every click, the market ultimately pays for performance. And advertisers are continuing to flock to PPC ad networks (and to Google in particular). While that doesn’t mean that firms can stop being vigilant, it does suggest that for most firms, Google seems to have the problem under control.</p>

                <li>Fraud can undermine the revenue model behind search engines, ad networks, and the ad-based Internet. It also threatens honest competition among rivals that advertise online.</li>
                <li>There are many forms of online fraud, including enriching fraud (meant to line the pockets of the perpetrators), depleting fraud (meant to waste the ad budgets of rivals), disbarring fraud (meant to frame the innocent as fraudsters), and methods to lower rival ad rank performance, or gain search engine ranking algorithms.</li>
                <li>While fraudsters have devised ingenious ways to exploit the system (including click farms and zombie attacks), IP addresses and detailed usage pattern monitoring increasingly reveal bogus activity.</li>
                <li>Fraud rates are widely disputed. However, it is clear that if widespread fraud were allowed to occur, advertisers would see lower ROI from online ad efforts, and Internet business models would suffer. The continued strength of the online advertising market suggests that while fraud may be impossible to stop completely, most fraud is under control.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p02">Google has been growing like gangbusters, but the firm’s twin engines of revenue growth—ads served on search and through its ad networks—will inevitably mature. And it will likely be difficult for Google to find new growth markets that are as lucrative as these. Emerging advertising outlets such as social networks have lower click-through rates than conventional advertising, and Google has struggled to develop a presence in social media—trends suggesting that Google will have to work harder for less money.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p03">To understand what can happen when maturity hits, look at Microsoft. The House that Gates Built is more profitable than Google, and continues to dominate the incredibly lucrative markets served by Windows and Office. But these markets haven’t grown much for over a decade. In industrialized nations, most Windows and Office purchases come not from growth, but when existing users upgrade or buy new machines. And without substantial year-on-year growth, the stock price doesn’t move.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p04">For big firms like Microsoft and Google, pushing stock price north requires not just new markets, but <em class="emphasis">billion-dollar</em> ones. Adding even $100 million in new revenues doesn’t do much for firms bringing in $62 billion and $29 billion a year, respectively. That’s why you see Microsoft swinging for the fences, investing in the uncertain but potentially gargantuan markets of video games, mobile phone software, cloud computing (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch10#fwk-38086-ch10">Chapter 10 "Software in Flux: Partly Cloudy and Sometimes Free"</a>), music and video, and of course, search and everything else that fuels online ad revenue. Finding new billion-dollar markets is wonderful, but rare. Apple seems to have done it with the iPad. But trying to unseat a dominant leader possessing strategic resources can be ferociously expensive, with unclear prospects for success. Microsoft’s Bing group lost over $2 billion over just nine months, winning almost no share from Google despite the lavish spend.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-063240-107969">D.

        <h3 class="title">Search: Google Rules, but It Ain’t Over</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p05">PageRank is by no means the last word in search, and offerings from Google and its rivals continue to evolve. Google supplements PageRank results with news, photos, video, and other categorizations. Yahoo! is continually refining its search algorithms and presentation. And Microsoft’s third entry into the search market, the “decision engine” Bing, sports nifty tweaks for specific kinds of queries. Restaurant searches in Bing are bundled with ratings stars, product searches show up with reviews and price comparisons, and airline flight searches not only list flight schedules and fares, but also a projection on whether those fares are likely go up or down. Bing also comes with a one-hundred-million-dollar marketing budget, showing that Microsoft is serious about search. And in the weeks following Bing’s mid-2009 introduction, the search engine did deliver Microsoft’s first substantive search engine market share gain in years.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p06">New tools like the Wolfram Alpha “knowledge engine” (and to a lesser extent, Google’s experimental Google Squared service) move beyond Web page rankings and instead aggregate data for comparison, formatting findings in tables and graphs. Web sites are also starting to wrap data in invisible tags that can be recognized by search engines, analysis tools, and other services. If a search engine can tell that a number on a restaurant’s Web site is, for example, either a street address, an average entrée price, or the seating capacity, it will be much easier for computer programs to accurately categorize, compare, and present this information. This is what geeks are talking about when they refer to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">semantic Web</a><span class="glossdef">Sites that wrap data in invisible tags that can be recognized by search engines, analysis tools, and other services to make it easier for computer programs to accurately categorize, compare, and present this information.</span></span>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_p07">Both Google and Microsoft are on a collision course. But there’s also an impressive roster of additional firms circling this space, each with the potential to be competitors, collaborators, merger partners, or all of the above. While wounded and shrinking, Yahoo! is still a powerhouse, ranking ahead of Google in some overall traffic statistics. Google’s competition with Apple in the mobile phone business prompted Google’s then CEO Eric Schmidt to resign from Apple’s board of directors. Meanwhile, Google’s three-quarters-of-a-billion-dollar purchase of the leading mobile advertiser AdMob was quickly followed by Apple snapping up number two mobile ad firm Quattro Wireless for $275 million. Add in Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Twitter, Salesforce.com, Netflix, the video game industry, telecom and mobile carriers, cable firms, and the major media companies and the next few years have the makings of a big, brutal fight.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Strategic Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p01">As outlined earlier, Google enjoys major scale advantages in search, and network effects in advertising. The firm’s dominance helps grow a data asset that can be used in service improvement, all while its expertise in core markets continues to grow over time. But the strength of Google’s other competitive resources is less clear.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p02">Within Google’s ad network, there are <em class="emphasis">switching costs</em> for advertisers and for content providers. Google partners have set up accounts and are familiar with the firm’s tools and analytics. Content providers would also need to modify Web sites to replace AdSense or DoubleClick ads with rivals. But choosing Google doesn’t cut out the competition. Many advertisers and content providers participate in multiple ad networks, making it easier to shift business from one firm to another. This likely means that Google will have to keep advertisers by offering superior value rather than relying on lock-in.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p03">Another vulnerability may exist with search consumers. While Google’s brand is strong, switching costs for search users are incredibly low. Move from Google.com to Bing.com and you actually save two letters of typing!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p04">Still, there are no signs that Google’s search leadership is in jeopardy. So far users have been creatures of habit; no rival has offered technology compelling enough to woo away the Googling masses. Defeating Google with some sort of technical advantage will be difficult since Web-based innovation can often be quickly imitated. Google now rolls out over 550 tweaks to its search algorithm annually, with many features mimicking or outdoing innovations from rivals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_062">S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p05">The Google Toolbar helps reinforce search habits among those who have it installed, and Google has paid the Mozilla foundation (the folks behind the Firefox browser) upwards of $66 million a year to serve as its default search option for the open source browser.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-064946-790451">S.

The firm has also spent nearly $1 billion to have Dell preinstall its computers with the Google browser toolbar and Google desktop search products. But Microsoft later inked deals that displaced Google on Dell machines, and it also edged Google out in a five-year search contract with Verizon Wireless.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-064946-790508">N.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p06">Microsoft could benefit from embedding its Bing search engine into its most popular products (imagine putting Bing in the right-mouseclick menu alongside <em class="emphasis">cut</em>, <em class="emphasis">copy</em>, and <em class="emphasis">paste</em>). But with Internet Explorer market share above 65 percent, Office above 80 percent, and Windows at roughly 90 percent,<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111128-115914-639039">Data source: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com">http://marketshare.hitslink.com</a>; and E.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p07">European antitrust officials have already taken action against Redmond’s bundling Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer with Windows. Add in a less favorable antitrust climate in the United States, and tying any of these products to Bing is almost certainly out of bounds. What’s not clear is whether regulators would allow Bing to be bundled with less dominant Microsoft offerings, such as mobile phone software, Xbox, and MSN.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p08">But increasingly, Google is also an antitrust target.

The Justice Department is also investigating a Google settlement with the Authors’ Guild, a deal in which critics have suggested that Google scored a near monopoly on certain book scanning, searching, and data serving rights.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111128-115914-639123">S. Wildstrom, “Google Book Search and the Dog in the Manger,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, April 18, 2009.</span> And yet another probe investigated whether Google colluded with Apple, Yahoo! and other firms to limit efforts to hire away top talent.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111128-115914-639141">E.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s01_p09">Of course, being big isn’t enough to violate U.S. antitrust law.

Helft, “New Mood in Antitrust May Target Google,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 18, 2009.</span> This may be a difficult case to make against a firm that has a history of being a relentless supporter of open computing standards. And as mentioned earlier, there is little forcing users to stick with Google—the firm must continue to win this market on its own merits. Some suggest regulators may see Google’s search dominance as an unfair advantage in promoting its own properties such as YouTube, Google Maps, Google-owned Zagat, and Google+ over those offered by rivals.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111128-115914-639173">F. Vogelstein, “Why Is Obama’s Top Antitrust Cop Gunning for Google?” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, July 20, 2009.</span> The toolbar that appears across the top of most Google websites also provides preferred access to Google properties but not rivals—some may argue that these advantages are not unlike Microsoft’s use of Windows to promote Media Player and Internet Explorer. While Google may escape all of these investigations, increased antitrust scrutiny is a downside that comes along with the advantages of market-dominating scale.</p>

The networks are meant to be open to other service providers and Google hopes to learn and share insights on how to build high-speed networks more efficiently. Google will also be watching to see how access to ultrahigh-speed networks impacts user behavior and fuels innovation. Globally, Google is also a major backer (along with Liberty Global and HSBC) of the O3b satellite network. O3b stands for “the other three billion” of the world’s population who currently lack Internet access. O3b plans to have multiple satellites circling the globe, blanketing underserved regions with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">low latency</a><span class="glossdef">Low delay.</span></span> (low delay), high-speed Internet access.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-065321-290921">O. Malik, “Google Invests in Satellite Broadband Startup,” <em class="emphasis">GigaOM</em>, September 9, 2008.</span> With Moore’s Law dropping computing costs as world income levels rise, Google hopes to empower the currently disenfranchised masses to start surfing. Good for global economies, good for living standards, and good for Google.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s02_p05">Google has also successfully lobbied the U.S. government to force wireless telecom carriers to be more open, dismantling what are known in the industry as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">walled gardens</a><span class="glossdef">A closed network or single set of services controlled by one dominant firm. Term is often applied to mobile carriers that act as gatekeepers, screening out hardware providers and software services from their networks.</span></span>. Before Google’s lobbying efforts, mobile carriers could act as gatekeepers, screening out hardware providers and software services from their networks. Now, paying customers of carriers that operate over the recently allocated U.S. wireless spectrum will have access to a choice of hardware and less restrictive access to Web sites and services. And Google hopes this expands its ability to compete without obstruction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s02_p03">Another way Google can lower the cost of surfing is by giving mobile phone software away for free. That’s the thinking behind the firm’s Android offering. With Android, Google provides mobile phone vendors with a Linux-based operating system, supporting tools, standards, and an application marketplace akin to Apple’s App Store. Android itself isn’t ad-supported—there aren’t Google ads embedded in the OS. But the hope is that if handset manufacturers don’t have to write their own software, the cost of wireless mobile devices will go down. And cheaper devices mean that more users will have access to the mobile Internet, adding more ad-serving opportunities for Google and its partner sites. Google already controls 97 percent of fast-growing paid search on mobile devices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_091">“Google Manages 97 Percent of Paid Mobile Search, 40 Pct of Google Maps Usage Is Mobile,” <em class="emphasis">Mobile Marketing Watch</em>, March 14, 2011.</span> One analyst estimates that Android should bring in $10 per handset in search advertising by 2012, goosing advertising revenue by about $1.3 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_092">G. Sterling, “Google Will Make $10 Per Android User in 2012: Report,” <em class="emphasis">SearchEngineLand</em>, February 9, 2011.</span> If this prediction holds, this would mean Android has helped Google deliver that rare, new billion-dollar opportunity that so many large firms seek.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s02_p04">Developers are now leveraging tailored versions of Android on a wide range of devices, including e-book readers, tablets, televisions, set-top boxes, robots, and automobiles. Google has dabbled in selling ads for television (as well as radio and print), and there may be considerable potential in bringing variants of ad targeting technology, search, and a host of other services across these devices. Google also offers a platform for creating what the firm calls “Chromebooks”—a direct challenge to Windows in the netbook PC market. Powered by a combination of open source Linux and Google’s open source Chrome browser, the Chrome OS is specifically designed to provide a lightweight but consistent user interface for applications that otherwise live in the cloud, preferably residing on Google’s server farms (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch10#fwk-38086-ch10" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 10 "Software in Flux: Partly Cloudy and Sometimes Free"</a>).</p>

Adding Google TV software into cable set-top boxes might also bring a Google app store to your television. Executing on these possibilities will be challenging, as most cable firms (the customers for Motorola’s set-top boxes) have fiercely defended their walled gardens from running apps from Netflix or other potentially threatening services.<span class="footnote" id="e84.gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111128-120048-454228">R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="e88.gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-065500-539463">It’s tough to imagine any peer-produced video site displacing YouTube. Users go to YouTube because there’s more content, while amateur content providers go there seeking more users (classic two-sided network effects). This critical advantage was the main reason why, in 2006, Google paid $1.65 billion for what was then just a twenty-month-old start-up. But Google isn’t content to let YouTube be simply the home for online amateur hour. The site now “rents” hundreds of TV shows and movies at prices raning from $.99 to $3.99 It’s also been offering seed grants of several million dollars to producers of original content for YouTube.<span class="footnote" id="e89.gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-065841-388666">M.

That’s a shortfall of more than $470 million. Analysts estimate that for YouTube to break even, it would need to achieve an ad CPM of $9.48 on each of the roughly seventy-five billion streams it’ll serve up this year. A tough task. For comparison, Hulu (a site that specializes in offering ad-supported streams of television shows and movies) earns CPM rates of thirty dollars and shares about 70 percent of this with copyright holders. Most user-generated content sports CPM rates south of a buck.<span class="footnote" id="e93.gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-072840-152975">B. Wayne, “YouTube Is Doomed,” Silicon Alley Insider, April 9, 2009.</span> Some differ with the Credit Suisse report—RampRate pegged the losses at $174 million. In fact, it may be in Google’s interest to allow others to think of YouTube as more of a money pit than it really is. That perception might keep rivals away longer, allowing the firm to solidify its dominant position, while getting the revenue model right. Even as a public company, Google can keep mum about YouTube specifics. Says the firm’s CFO, “We know our cost position, but nobody else does.”<span class="footnote" id="e94.gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-072840-152993">“How Can YouTube Survive?” Independent, July 7, 2009.</span></p>

The firm is still experimenting with ad models—these include traditional banner and text ads, plus ads transparently layered across the bottom 20 percent of the screen, <em class="emphasis">preroll</em> commercials that appear before the selected video, and more.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s03_p01a">Google Wallet is another example of how the search giant is looking to deliver value through mobile devices. Announced in the spring of 2011, Google Wallet allows phones to replace much of the “stuff” inside your wallet. It can be used to pay for goods, store gift cards, collect and redeem coupons and special offers, and manage loyalty programs. To use the service, users simply wave phones at an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">NFC</a><span class="glossdef">Near field communication; a short-range, wireless communication standard. NFC is being used to support contactless payment and transactions over NFC-equipped mobile devices.</span></span> (near field communication)-equipped payment terminal (with transaction confirmed and secured by typing in a PIN). Fifteen retailers (including Macy’s, Subway, Walgreens, Toys “R” Us, Peet’s Coffee and Tea, and Footlocker) were announced as payment-accepting partners, and Wallet has the capability to work with some 300,000 retail registers that are already using MasterCard’s PayPass contactless payment terminals.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111127-193120-031449">D.

Hamburger, “Google Introduces Wallet, Google Wallet Works at Over 300,000 MasterCard PayPass Merchants,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessInsider</em>, May 26, 2011.</span> Phones will have to be equipped with an NFC chip, and only one model from one carrier was available at announcement, although a limited version of Wallet will be available by using an NFC sticker that can be attached to the back of non-NFC mobile devices. Google also envisions billboards and storefronts that can communicate with Wallet and distribute offers, Web links, and more—just wave your phone at a sign to get a deal. The product is less about becoming the “Bank of Google”—Wallet links to existing credit cards (although Google offers a prepaid card, too), and at rollout Google said there would be no payment fees for the service. But Google hopes payment and other services will be a way to promote new revenue channels, such as growing its Google Offers coupon service, allowing it to compete with daily deal sites like Groupon and LivingSocial.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111127-193120-031526">H. Tsukayama, “Google Wallet: Search Giant Introduces Automatic Cellphone Payment System,” The Washington Past, May 26, 2011.</span>. Google could sell advertisers couponing services distributed via search, online ads, NFC-equipped signs, and geolocation; have the deals and promotions delivered to a Google Wallet account; and allow deals to be quickly redeemed via NFC swipe at a retailer. Could this grow to be a billion-dollar market, too? Emerging technologies like NFC are sure to attract competitors and innovation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social: Google+</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s03_p01">Google’s success in social media has been mixed. Its two biggest successes—YouTube and Blogger—were both acquired from other firms. Internally-developed Orkut has for years ranked as the top social network in Brazil but has limited success in only a few other nations; and Google-hatched Buzz and Wave were both dismal failures. But with Google+ the firm may have finally created a service with staying power. </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-074223-135198">Google+ rolled out in summer 2011 as an integrated collection of social products associated with a user’s Google profile. Stream is a newsfeed. Sparks is a recommendation engine. Hangouts is a video chat service that can support groups, and enables screen sharing and group document editing. Huddle offers group texting. Circles helps manage sharing contacts (so you can share a given item with just ‘friends,’ ‘business contacts,’ or any other sharing circles you want to create). And Photos is an image sharing service that leverages the firm’s Picasa offering. This allows Google to offer up a set of features similar to those found in Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Skype, and Group.me. And initial Google+ features were just a start—the firm has been hard at work adding Games, Questions, services that allow businesses to get in on the socializing, and more.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-074223-135335">Learning from earlier failure, Google+ got a lot of things right. The interface design was praised (Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original Macintosh design team, was behind design efforts), and the new features were tightly integrated with other Google products. A toolbar that runs on top of most Google services means that Google+ is just a click away. Circles were easily built from Gmail contacts, but offered a degree of sharing control, customization, and privacy that distinguished it as a solid alternative to Facebook and other offerings. Despite being launched only in invitation-only beta, Google+ attracted some 10 million members in just its first two weeks, making it the fastest growing social network of all time.<span class="footnote" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111117-075333-740325">D. Goldman, “Google+ Grows to 10 Million Users,” Fortune, July 14, 2011. M. Schuster, M. Schuster, “Report: Google+ the Fastest-Growing Social Network Ever,” Minyanville, July 12, 2011.</span> While growing faster than Facebook and Twitter did at this stage, the Google+ user base is still very far behind both. If Google+ is a hit, the firm could gain an opportunity to serve more ads, grow additional revenue lines (e.g. a game currency to rival Facebook Credits), and gain additional data and insight that can be used to help in search, content recommendations, and ad targeting. Competing in winner-take-most markets where network effects dominate will be tough, but Google brings a number of assets to the table and seems committed to growing the effort. CEO Larry Page has event stated Google will tie employee bonuses to the success of the firm’s social efforts.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p04">Google’s “apps” are mostly Web-based software-as-a-service offerings. Apps include an Office-style suite that sports a word processor, presentation tool, and spreadsheet, all served through a browser. While initially clunky, the products are constantly being refined. The spreadsheet product, for example, has been seeing new releases every two weeks, with features such as graphing and pivot tables inching it closer in capabilities to desktop alternatives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_078">D. Girouard, “Google Inc. Presentation” (Bank of America and Merrill Lynch 2009 Technology Conference, New York, June 4, 2009).</span> And new browser standards, such as HTML 5, will make it even easier for what lives in the browser to mimic what you’re currently using on your desktop, even allowing apps to be used offline when net access isn’t available. That’ll be critical as long as Internet access is less reliable than your hard drive, but online collaboration is where these products can really excel (no pun intended). Most Google apps allow not only group viewing, but also collaborative editing, common storage, and version control. And it seems Google isn’t stopping at Office files, video, and photos—Google’s cloud will hold your music, too. Google’s Music service allows you to not only buy music, but also upload thousands of the tracks that you already own to what some have called a sort of “locker in the sky.” Users can stream the tracks over the Internet, sync frequently played songs and albums for offline play, and even share tracks with friends via Google+ (friends usually get one full listen for free).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_097">D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p05">Unknown is how much money Google will make off all of this. Consumers and small businesses have free access to these products, with usage for up to fifty users funded by in-app ads. But is there much of a market serving ads to people working on spreadsheets? Enterprises can gain additional, ad-free licenses for a fee. While users have been reluctant to give up Microsoft Office, many have individually migrated to Google’s Web-based e-mail and calendar tools. Google’s enterprise apps group will now do the same thing for organizations, acting as a sort of outsourcer by running e-mail, calendar, and other services for a firm and all while handling upgrades, spam screening, virus protection, backup, and other administrative burdens. Virgin America, Jaguar, National Geographic, and Genentech are among the Google partners that have signed on to make the firm’s app offerings available to thousands.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p06">And of course, Microsoft won’t let Google take this market without a fight. Microsoft has experimented with offering a simplified, free, ad-supported, Web-based, online options for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote; Office 365 offers more robust online tools, ad free, for a low monthly subscription cost; and Microsoft can also migrate an organization’s applications like e-mail and calendaring off corporate computers and onto Microsoft’s server farms.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p07">In the spring of 2010, Google clashed publicly with the government of China, a nation that many consider to be the world’s most potentially lucrative market. For the previous four years and at the request of the Chinese government, Google had censored results returned from the firm’s google.cn domain (e.g., an image search on the term “Tiananmen” showed kite flying on google.cn, but protestors confronting tanks on google.com). However, when reports surfaced of Chinese involvement in hacking attempts against Google and at least twenty other U.S. companies and human rights dissidents, the firm began routing google.cn traffic outside the country. The days that followed saw access to a variety of Google services blocked within China, restricted by what many call the government’s “Great Firewall of China.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p08">Speaking for Google, the firm’s deputy counsel Nicole Wong states, “We are fundamentally guided by the belief that more information for our users is ultimately better.” But even outside of China, Google continues to be challenged by its interest in providing unfettered access to information on one hand, and the radically divergent laws, regulations, and cultural expectations of host nations on the other. Google has been prompted to block access to its services at some point in at least twenty-five of one hundred countries the firm operates in.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p09">The kind of restriction varies widely. French, German, and Polish law requires Google to prohibit access to Nazi content. Turkish law requires Google to block access to material critical of the nation’s founder. Access in Thailand is similarly blocked from content mocking that nation’s king. In India, Google has been prompted to edit forums or remove comments flagged by the government as violating restrictions against speech that threatens public order or is otherwise considered indecent or immoral. At the extreme end of the spectrum, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, have aggressively moved to restrict access to wide swaths of Internet content.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p10">Google usually waits for governments to notify it that offensive content must be blocked. This moves the firm from actively to reactively censoring access. Still, this doesn’t isolate the company from legal issues. Italian courts went after YouTube executives after a video showing local teenagers tormenting an autistic child remained online long enough to garner thousands of views.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p11">In the United States, Google’s organic results often reveal content that would widely be viewed as offensive. In the most extreme cases, the firm has run ads alongside these results with the text, “Offensive Search Results: We’re disturbed about these results as well. Please read our note here.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p12">Other Internet providers have come under similar scrutiny, and technology managers will continue to confront similar ethically charged issues as they consider whether to operate in new markets. But Google’s dominant position puts it at the center of censorship concerns. The threat is ultimately that the world’s chief information gateway might also become “the Web’s main muzzle.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p13">It’s not until considered in its entirety that one gets a sense of what Google has the potential to achieve. It’s possible that increasing numbers of users worldwide will adopt light, cheap netbooks and other devices powered by free Google software (Android, Google’s Chrome browser and Chrome OS). Productivity apps, e-mail, calendaring, and collaboration tools will all exist in the cloud, accessible through any browser, with files stored on Google’s servers in a way that minimizes hard drive needs. Google will entertain you, help you find the information you need, help you shop, handle payment, and more. And the firms you engage online may increasingly turn to Google to replace their existing hardware and software infrastructure with corporate computing platforms like Google Apps Engine (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch10#fwk-38086-ch10">Chapter 10 "Software in Flux: Partly Cloudy and Sometimes Free"</a>). All of this would be based on open standards, but switching costs, scale, and increasing returns from expertise across these efforts could yield enormous advantages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s10_s04_p14">Studying Google allowed us to learn about search and the infrastructure that powers this critical technology. We’ve studied the business of ads, covering search advertising, ad networks, and ad targeting in a way that blends strategic and technology issues. And we’ve covered the ethical, legal, growth, and competitive challenges that Google and its rivals face. Studying Google in this context should not only help you understand what’s happening today, it should also help you develop critical thinking skills for assessing the opportunities and threats that will emerge across industries as technologies continue to evolve.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li> For over a decade, Google’s business has been growing rapidly, but that business is maturing. </li>
                <li> Slower growth will put pressure on the firm’s stock price, so a firm Google’s size will need to pursue very large, risky, new markets—markets that are also attractive to well-financed rivals, smaller partners, and entrepreneurs. </li>
                <li> Rivals continue to innovate in search. Competing with technology is extremely difficult since it is often easy for a firm to mimic the innovations of a pioneer with a substitute offering. Microsoft, with profits to invest in infrastructure, advertising, and technology, may pose Google’s most significant, conventional threat. </li>
                <li> Although Microsoft has many distribution channels (Windows, Internet Explorer, Office) for its search and other services, European and U.S. regulators will likely continue to prevent the firm from aggressive product and service bundling. </li>
                <li> Google is investing heavily in methods that promote wider Internet access. These include offering free software to device manufacturers and several telecommunications and lobbying initiatives meant to lower the cost of getting online. The firm hopes that more users spending more time online will allow it to generate more revenue through ads and perhaps other services. </li>
                <li> Google Wallet uses NFC communications to allow mobile phones to make credit and debit card payments, manage loyalty programs, redeem coupons, and more. Payments are linked to existing credit cards. Google will not charge for transaction fees but plans to use Wallet as a way to sell other services such as those offered by its Google Offers coupon and deal program. </li>
                <li> YouTube demonstrates how a firm can create a large and vastly influential business in a short period of time but also that businesses that host and serve large files of end-user content can be costly. </li>
                <li> Google, Microsoft, and smaller rivals are also migrating applications to the Web, allowing Office-style software to execute within a browser, with portions of this computing experience and storage happening off a user’s computer, “in the cloud” of the Internet. Revenue models for this business are also uncertain. </li>
                <li> With scale and influence comes increased governmental scrutiny. Google has increasingly become a target of antitrust regulators. The extent of this threat is unclear. Google’s extreme influence is clear. However, the firm’s software is based on open standards; competitors have a choice in ad networks, search engines, and other services; switching costs are relatively low; users and advertisers aren’t locked into exclusive contracts for the firm’s key products and services; and there is little evidence of deliberate, predatory pricing or other “red-flag” activity that usually brings government regulation. </li>

            <h3 class="title">Questions and Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist">
                <li> Perform identical queries on both Google and on rival search engines. Try different categories (research for school projects, health, business, sports, entertainment, local information). Which sites do you think give you the better results? Why? Would any of these results cause you to switch to one search engine versus the other? </li>
                <li> Investigate new services that attempt to extend the possibilities for leveraging online content. Visit Bing, Google Squared, Wolfram Alpha, and any other such efforts that intrigue you. Assume the role of a manager and use these engines to uncover useful information. Assume your role as a student and see if these tools provide valuable information for this or other classes. Are you likely to use these tools in the future? Why or why not? Under what circumstances are they useful and when do they fall short? </li>
                <li> Assume the role of an industry analyst: Consider the variety of firms mentioned in this section that may become competitors or partners. Create a chart listing your thoughts on which firms are likely to collaborate and work together and which firms are likely to compete. What are the advantages or risks in these collaborations for the partners involved? Do you think any of these firms are “acquisition bait?” Defend your predictions and be prepared to discuss them with your class. </li>
                <li> Assume the role of an IT manager: To the extent that you can, evaluate online application offerings by Google, Microsoft, and rivals. In your opinion, are these efforts ready for prime time? Why or why not? Would you recommend that a firm choose these applications? Are there particular firms or users that would find these alternatives particularly appealing? Would you ever completely replace desktop offerings with online ones? Why or why not? </li>
                <li> Does it make sense for organizations to move their e-mail and calendaring services off their own machines and pay Google, Microsoft, or someone else to run them? Why or why not? </li>
                <li> What are Chrome, the Chrome OS, and Android? Are these software products successful in their respective categories? Investigate the state of the market for products that leverage any of these software offerings. Would you say that they are successful? Why or why not? What do you think the outlook is for Chrome, the Chrome OS, and Android? As an IT manager, would you recommend products based on this software? As an investor, do you think it continues to make sense for Google to develop these efforts? Why or why not? </li>
                <li> What will it take for Google Wallet to be successful? What challenges must the effort overcome? </li>
                <li> Research the current state of Google Wallet’s competitors. What competing efforts exist? Which firms are best positioned to dominate this market? How large could this market become? </li>
                <li> Google’s unofficial motto is “Don’t be evil.” But sometimes it’s challenging for managers to tell what path is “most right” or “least wrong.” Google operates in countries that require the firm to screen and censor results. Short term, this is clearly a limitation on freedom of speech. But long-term, access to the Internet could catalyze economic development and spread information in a way that leads to more democratization. Investigate and consider both of these arguments and be prepared to argue the case either for limiting work in speech-limiting countries or working within them as a potential agent of change. What other pressures is a publicly traded firm under to choose one path or the other? Which path would you choose and why? </li>
