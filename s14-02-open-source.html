But Linus Torvalds did just that. During a marathon six-month coding session, Torvalds created the first version of Linux<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_003">D. Diamond, “The Good-Hearted Wizard—Linus Torvalds,” <em class="emphasis">Virtual Finland</em>, January 2008.</span> marshalling open source revolutionaries like no one before him.

Today Linux powers everything from cell phones to stock exchanges, set top boxes to supercomputers. You’ll find the OS on 16 to 30 percent of the servers in corporate America (depending on how you slice the numbers),<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_004">Sarah Lacy, “Open Warfare in Open Source,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, August 21, 2006; “Worldwide Server Market Revenues Increase 12.1% in First Quarter as Market Demand Continues to Improve, according to IDC,” <em class="emphasis">IDC</em>, May 24, 2011.</span> on about one in four smartphones,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_080">“Gartner Says Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales Grew 35 Percent in Third Quarter 2010; Smartphone Sales Increased 96 Percent,” <em class="emphasis">Gartner</em>, November 10, 2010.</span> and supporting most Web servers (including those at Google, Amazon, and Facebook). Linux forms the core of the TiVo operating system, it underpins Google’s Android and Chrome OS offerings, and it has even gone interplanetary.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s02_p03">Most English speakers in the know pronounce Linux in a way that rhymes with “<em class="emphasis">cynics</em>.” You can easily search online to hear video and audio clips of Linus (whose name is actually pronounced “Lean-us” in Finish) pronouncing the name of his OS. In deference to Linux, some geeks prefer something that sounds more like “<em class="emphasis">lean-ooks</em>.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_006">For examples, see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mostlylinux.ca/pronounce/torvalds-says-linux.wav">http://mostlylinux.ca/pronounce/torvalds-says-linux.wav</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://suseroot.com/about-suse-linux/how-do-you-pronounce-linux.php">http://suseroot.com/about-suse-linux/how-do-you-pronounce-linux.php</a>.</span> Just don’t call it “<em class="emphasis">line-ucks</em>,” or the tech-savvy will think you’re an open source <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">n00b</a><span class="glossdef">Written with two zeros, pronounced “newb.” Geek-slang (leet speak) derogatory term for an uninformed or unskilled person.</span></span>!

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s02_p04">Open source software (OSS) is often described as free. While most OSS can be downloaded for free over the Internet, it’s also “free” as in liberated (you may even see the acronym FLOSS for free/libre/open source software). The source code for OSS products is openly shared. Anyone can look at the source code, change it, and even redistribute it, provided the modified software continues to remain open and free.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_007">A list of criteria defining open source software can be found at the Open Source Initiative at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://opensource.org/osr">http://opensource.org/osr</a>.</span>  This openness is in stark contrast to the practice of conventional software firms, who treat their intellectual property as closely guarded secrets and who almost never provide the source code for their commercial software products. At times, many software industry execs have been downright hostile toward OSS. The former President of SAP once referred to the open source movement as “socialism,” while Microsoft’s Steve Balmer has called Linux a “cancer.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_008">J. Fortt, “Why Larry Loves Linux (and He’s Not Alone),” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, December 19, 2007.</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s02_p05">But while execs at some firms see OSS as a threat undermining the lifeblood of their economic model, other big-name technology companies are now solidly behind the open source movement. The old notion of open source being fueled on the contributions of loners tooling away for the glory of contributing to better code is now largely inaccurate. The vast majority of people who work on efforts like Linux are now paid to do so by commercially motivated employers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_009">D. Woods, “The Commercial Bear Hug of Open Source,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, August 18, 2008.</span> Nearly every major hardware firm has paid staff contributing to open source projects, and most firms also work together to fund foundations that set standards and coordinate the release of product revisions and improvements. Such coordination is critical—helping, for example, to ensure that various versions of Linux work alike. Sun Microsystems claims to have eleven thousand engineers contributing to OSS.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_010">C. Preimesberger, “Sun’s ‘Open’-Door Policy,” <em class="emphasis">eWeek</em>, April 21, 2008.</span> Guido van Rossum, the inventor of the open source Python programming language, works for Google where he continues to coordinate development. IBM programmers work on several open source projects, including Linux. The firm has even deeded a commercially developed programming tool (including an IDE) to the Eclipse foundation, where it’s now embraced and supported by dozens of firms.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s02_l02">
            <li>OSS is not only available for free, but also makes source code available for review and modification (for the Open Source Initiatives list of the criteria that define an open source software product, see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">http://opensource.org/docs/osd</a>).</li>
            <li>While open source alternatives are threatening to conventional software firms, some of the largest technology companies now support OSS initiatives and work to coordinate standards, product improvements, and official releases.</li>
            <li>The flagship OSS product is the Linux operating system, now available on all scales of computing devices from cell phones to supercomputers.</li>
            <li>The LAMP stack of open source products is used to power many of the Internet’s most popular Web sites. Linux can be found on 30 percent of corporate servers, supports most Web servers, and is integral to TiVo and Android-based cell phones.</li>
            <li>The majority of persons who work on open source projects are paid by commercially motivated employers.</li>
