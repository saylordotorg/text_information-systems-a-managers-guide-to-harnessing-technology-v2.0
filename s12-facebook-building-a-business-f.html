        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rise of Facebook</h2>
        <p class="para block">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg looked like a social media pioneer from the start. Consider this: During the weeks he spent working on Facebook as a Harvard sophomore, he didn’t have time to study for a course he was taking, “Art in the Time of Augustus,” so he built a Web site containing all of the artwork in class and pinged his classmates to contribute to a communal study guide. Within hours, the wisdom of crowds produced a sort of custom CliffsNotes for the course, and after reviewing the Web-based crib sheet, he aced the test. Turns out he didn’t need to take that exam, anyway. Zuck (that’s what the cool kids call him)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_001">For an insider account of Silicon Valley Web 2.0 start-ups, see Sarah Lacy, <em class="emphasis">Once You’re Lucky, Twice You’re Good: The Rebirth of Silicon Valley and the Rise of Web 2.0</em>. (New York: Gotham Books, 2008).</span> dropped out of Harvard later that year.</p>
        <p class="para block">Zuckerberg is known as both a shy, geeky, introvert who eschews parties, and as a brash Silicon Valley bad boy. After Facebook’s incorporation, Zuckerberg’s job description was listed as “Founder, Master and Commander [and] Enemy of the State.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_002">T. McGinn, “Online Facebooks Duel over Tangled Web of Authorship,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Crimson</em>, May 28, 2004.</span> An early business card read “I’m CEO…Bitch.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_003">C. Hoffman, “The Battle for Facebook,” <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em>, June 26, 2008, 9.</span> And let’s not forget that Facebook came out of drunken experiments in his dorm room, one of which was a system for comparing classmates to farm animals (Zuckerberg, threatened with expulsion, later apologized). For one meeting with Sequoia Capital, the venerable Menlo Park venture capital firm that backed Google and YouTube, Zuckerberg showed up in his pajamas.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_004">C. Hoffman, “The Battle for Facebook,” <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em>, June 26, 2008.</span></p>
        <p class="para block">By the age of twenty-three, Mark Zuckerberg had graced the cover of <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, been profiled on <em class="emphasis">60 Minutes</em>, and was discussed in the tech world with a reverence previously reserved only for Steve Jobs and the Google guys, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. But Mark Zuckerberg’s star rose much faster than any of his predecessors. Just two weeks after Facebook launched, the firm had four thousand users. Ten months later it was up to one million. The growth continued, and the business world took notice. In 2006, Viacom (parent of MTV) saw that its core demographic was spending a ton of time on Facebook and offered to buy the firm for three quarters of a billion dollars. Zuckerberg passed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_005">S. Rosenbush, “Facebook’s on the Block,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, March 28, 2006.</span> Yahoo! offered up a cool billion (twice). Zuck passed again, both times.</p>
        <p class="para block">As growth skyrocketed, Facebook built on its stranglehold of the college market (over 85 percent of four-year college students are Facebook members), opening up first to high schoolers, then to everyone. Web hipsters started selling shirts emblazoned with “I Facebooked your Mom!” Even Microsoft wanted some of Facebook’s magic. In 2006, the firm temporarily locked up the right to broker all banner ad sales that run on the U.S. version of Facebook, guaranteeing Zuckerberg’s firm $100 million a year through 2011. In 2007, Microsoft came back, buying 1.6 percent of the firm for $240 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_006">While Microsoft had cut deals to run banner ads worldwide, Facebook dropped banner ads for poor performance in early 2010; see C. McCarthy, “More Social, Please: Facebook Nixes Banner Ads,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, February 5, 2010.</span></p>
        <p class="para block">The investment was a shocker. Do the math and a 1.6 percent stake for $240 million values Facebook at $15 billion (more on that later). That meant that a firm that at the time had only five hundred employees, $150 million in revenues, and was helmed by a twenty-three-year-old college dropout in his first “real job,” was more valuable than General Motors. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owned rival MySpace, engaged in a little trash talk, referring to Facebook as “the flavor of the month.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_007">B. Morrissey, “Murdoch: Facebook Is ‘Flavor of the Month,’” <em class="emphasis">Media Week</em>, June 20, 2008.</span></p>
        <p class="para block">Watch your back, Rupert. Or on second thought, watch Zuckerberg’s. Facebook blew past MySpace, leaving the latter hemorrhaging users and cash. Six years after acquiring MySpace for $580 million, Newscorp sold the firm for $35 million, less than 1/16th the purchase price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_087">J. Vascellaro, E. Steel, and R. Adams, “NewsCorp Sells MySpace for a Song,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, June 30, 2011.</span> Murdoch, the media titan who stood atop an empire that includes the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> and Fox, had been utterly schooled by “the kid.”</p>
        <p class="para block">And now that shocking valuation by Microsoft seems like small change. By early 2011, shares trading on private markets valued the seven-year-old firm at $70 billion, and many expect it to go higher. As for Zuckerberg, he was named <em class="emphasis">Time</em>’s “Person of the Year,” while a (mostly fictionalized) account of Facebook’s founding<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_088">L. Grossman, “Person of the Year: Mark Zuckerberg,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, December 15, 2010.</span> was a box-office smash, nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Zuckerberg Rules!</h3>
            <p class="para">Many entrepreneurs accept start-up capital from venture capitalists (VCs), investor groups that provide funding in exchange for a stake in the firm and often, a degree of managerial control (usually in the form of a voting seat or seats on the firm’s board of directors). Typically, the earlier a firm accepts VC money, the more control these investors can exert (earlier investments are riskier, so VCs can demand more favorable terms). VCs usually have deep entrepreneurial experience and a wealth of contacts, and can often offer important guidance and advice, but strong investor groups can oust a firm’s founder and other executives if they’re dissatisfied with the firm’s performance.</p>
            <p class="para">At Facebook, however, Zuckerberg owns an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the company and controlled three of five seats on the firm’s board of directors (the firm only recently expanded the number of directors). That meant he was virtually guaranteed to remain in control of the firm, regardless of what investors said. Maintaining this kind of control is unusual in a start-up, and his influence is a testament to the speed with which Facebook expanded. By the time Zuckerberg reached out to VCs, his firm was so hot that he could call the shots, giving up surprisingly little in exchange for their money.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Study Facebook?</h2>
        <p class="para block">Looking at the “flavor of the month” and trying to distinguish the reality from the hype is a critical managerial skill. In Facebook’s case, there are a lot of folks with a vested interest in figuring out where the firm is headed. If you want to work there, are you signing on to a firm where your <em class="emphasis">stock options</em> and <em class="emphasis">401k</em> contributions are going to be worth something or worthless? If you’re an investor and Facebook <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">goes public</a><span class="glossdef">The first time a firm sells stock to the public; formally called an initial public stock offering (IPO).</span></span>, should you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short</a><span class="glossdef">Short selling is an attempt to profit from a falling stock price.

They then repay share debt with shares purchased at a lower price and pocket the difference (spread) between initial share price and repayment price.</span></span> the firm or increase your holdings? Would you invest in or avoid firms that rely on Facebook’s business? Should your firm rush to partner with the firm? Would you extend the firm credit? Offer it better terms to secure its growing business, or worse terms because you think it’s a risky bet? Is this firm the next Google (underestimated at first, and now wildly profitable and influential), the next GeoCities (Yahoo! paid $3 billion for it—no one goes to the site today), or the next Skype (deeply impactful with over half a billion accounts worldwide, but so far, not much of a profit generator)? The jury is still out on all this, but let’s look at the fundamentals with an eye to applying what we’ve learned. No one has a crystal ball, but we do have some key concepts that can guide our analysis. There are a lot of broadly applicable managerial lessons that can be gleaned by examining Facebook’s successes and missteps. Studying the firm provides a context for examining nework effects, platforms, partnerships, issues in the rollout of new technologies, privacy, ad models, the business value of social media, and more.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Facebook’s Copilot</h3>
            <p class="para">Don’t let Zuck get all the credit. While Facebook’s founder is considered the firm’s visionary, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg is often depicted as the person who runs the place: the coach, the seasoned mentor, the drill sergeant, and the lead “adult” in a workforce that skews remarkably young despite its vast, global influence.</p>
            <p class="para">Regularly named to <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s “Most Powerful Women in Business” list, Sandberg came to Facebook from Google (before that she was chief of staff to U.S. Treasury secretary Larry Summers). In just three years, she’s helped steer Facebook to almost unimaginable heights. Users increased tenfold, she’s helped devise an advertising platform that has attracted the world’s largest brands, she’s developed a sales organization that can serve a customer base ranging from the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 100 to mom-and-pop stores, and she’s helped the firm through several crises, all while turning a profit and pushing revenue higher.</p>
            <p class="para">Sandberg, a Harvard grad, left the school with a geeky legacy akin to Zuckerberg’s. When she was a student conducting economics research she ran so much data on Harvard’s network that she choked the system. Zuckerberg would have much the same impact more than a decade later.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_089">B. Stone, “Why Facebook Needs Sheryl Sandberg,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, May 16, 2011.</span></p>
            <p class="para">Sheryl Sandberg is a powerful speaker and a leading advocate for increasing the ranks of women in senior management.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s02_p04">Facebook isn’t just a collection of personal home pages and a place to declare your allegiance to your friends. Facebook is gradually turning on features that allow it to leverage its massive user base to encroach on a wide swath of Internet businesses. Consider photos. Google, Yahoo!, and MySpace all spent millions to acquire photo sharing sites (Picasa, Flickr, and Photobucket, respectively). But Facebook didn’t acquire anyone. The site simply turned on a substandard photo-sharing feature and quickly became the biggest photo-sharing site on the Web. Facebook users now post over three billion photos each month.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_016">J. Kincaid, “Facebook Users Uploaded a Record 750 Million Photos over New Year’s,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, January 3, 2011.</span></p>
    <p class="para block">Video is also on the rise, with Facebookers sharing eight million videos each month. YouTube will get you famous, but Facebook is the place most go to share clips they only want friends to see.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_090">F. Vogelstein, “Mark Zuckerberg: The Wired Interview,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 29, 2009.</span> And with all those eyeballs turning to Facebook for video, why not become a destination to watch movies and TV shows, too? Facebook has worked with major studios to stream “rentals” of blockbusters that include <em class="emphasis">The Dark Knight</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter</em> films, and <em class="emphasis">Inception</em>. Netflix integrates so tightly with Facebook that the firm’s CEO sits on Facebook’s board.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para block">Other markets are also under attack. Facebook has become the <em class="emphasis">first-choice</em> communication service for this generation, and with Facebook’s unified messaging feature, the site will prioritize e-mail, text messages, and chat in a single inbox, bubbling your friends ahead of the spam. It’ll even give you a facebook.com e-mail address.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_092">M. Helft, “Facebook Offers New Messaging Tool,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 15, 2010.</span> Look out Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo!—if users check mail within Facebook, they may visit the big e-mail players less often (meaning less ad revenue for the e-mail firms).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s02_p05">Facebook is a kingmaker, opinion catalyst, and traffic driver, so media outlets want to be friends. Games firms, music services, video sites, daily deal services, media outlets, and more, all integrate into Facebook’s Ticker, each hoping that a quick post of activity to Facebook will help spread their services virally. While in the prior decade news stories would carry a notice saying, “Copyright, do not distribute without permission,” major news outlets today display Facebook icons alongside every copyrighted story, encouraging users to “share” the content on their profile pages. Great for Facebook, but a sharp elbow to Digg.com and Del.icio.us, which have both seen their link sharing appeal free-fall, even though they showed up first.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_093">D.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s02_p07">As for search, Facebook’s tinkering there, as well. Google indexes some Facebook content, but since much of Facebook is private, accessible only among friends, this represents a massive blind spot for Google search. Sites that can’t be indexed by Google and other search engines are referred to as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dark Web</a><span class="glossdef">Internet content that can’t be indexed by Google and other search engines.</span></span>. Facebook has repeatedly expanded its partnership with Microsoft’s Bing, and now content that Facebook users have “liked” can influence the ranking of Bing search results. If Facebook can tie together standard Internet search with its dark Web content, this just might be enough for some to break the Google habit.</p>
    <p class="para block">Facebook’s increasing dominance, long reach, and widening ambition have a lot of people worried, including the creator of the World Wide Web.

Facebook also developed Cassandra, a non-SQL database project for large-scale systems that the firm has since turned over to the open source Apache Software Foundation.

        <p class="para">Want to build your own server farm like Facebook? The firm will tell you how to do it. In an unprecedented move that coincided with the opening of its Prineville, Oregon, facility, Facebook made public the detailed specifications of its homegrown servers (including custom power supplies, chassis, and battery backup), plus plans used in the Prineville site’s building design and electrical and cooling systems. You can find details, photos, and video at opencompute.org. Facebook claims its redesigned servers are 38 percent more efficient and 24 percent cheaper than those sold by major manufacturers. Why give away the low-cost secrets? Says the firm’s director of hardware, “Facebook is successful because of the great social product, not [because] we can build low-cost infrastructure. There’s no reason we shouldn’t help others out with this.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_099">T.

            <li>Facebook’s position as the digital center of its members’ online social lives has allowed the firm to envelop related businesses such as photo and video sharing, messaging, bookmarking, and link sharing. Facebook has opportunities to expand into other areas as well.</li>
            <li>Much of the site’s content is in the dark Web, unable to be indexed by Google or other search engines. Some suggest this may create an opportunity for Facebook to challenge Google in search.</li>
            <li>Some fear that Facebook may be an all-too-powerful walled garden that may stifle innovation, limit competition, and restrict the free flow of information.</li>
            <li>Facebook’s growth requires a continued and massive infrastructure investment. The site is powered largely on commodity hardware, open source software, and proprietary code tailored to the specific needs of the service.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s03_p02">At the heart of Facebook’s appeal is a concept Zuckerberg calls the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social graph</a><span class="glossdef">The global mapping of users and organizations, and how they are connected.</span></span>, which refers to Facebook’s ability to collect, express, and leverage the connections between the site’s users, or as some describe it, “the global mapping of everyone and how they’re related.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_026">A. Iskold, “Social Graph: Concepts and Issues,” <em class="emphasis">ReadWriteWeb</em>, September 12, 2007.</span> Think of all the stuff that’s on Facebook as a node or endpoint that’s connected to other stuff. You’re connected to other users (your friends), photos about you are tagged, comments you’ve posted carry your name, you’re a member of groups, you’re connected to applications you’ve installed—Facebook links them all.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_027">A.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s03_p04">Facebook was established in the relatively safe cocoon of American undergraduate life and was conceived as a place where you could <em class="emphasis">reinforce</em> contacts among those who, for the most part, you already knew. The site was one of the first social networks where users actually identified themselves using their real names. If you wanted to establish that you worked for a certain firm or were a student of a particular university, you had to verify that you were legitimate via an e-mail address issued by that organization. It was this “realness” that became Facebook’s distinguishing feature—bringing along with it a degree of safety and comfort that enabled Facebook to become a true social utility and build out a solid social graph consisting of verified relationships. Since “friending” (which is a link between nodes in the social graph) required both users to approve the relationship, the network fostered an incredible amount of trust. Today, many Facebook users post their cell phone numbers and their birthdays, offer personal photos, and otherwise share information they’d never do outside their circle of friends. Because of trust, Facebook’s social graph is incredibly strong. Contrast this with early rival MySpace that was rife with imposters and fake profiles. Even News Corporation’s Rupert Murdoch has had to contend with the dozens of bogus MySpace Ruperts!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_100">L.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s03_p05">There is also a strong <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">network effect</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as Metcalfe’s Law, or network externalities.

People are attracted to the service because others they care about are more likely to be there than anywhere else online. And that large user base has also attracted all sorts of firms and organizations looking to connect with Facebook’s masses. Without the network effect Facebook wouldn’t exist. And it’s because of the network effect that another smart kid in a dorm can’t rip off Zuckerberg in any market where Facebook is the biggest fish. Even an exact copy of Facebook would be a virtual ghost town with no social graph (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38086-ch07_s03_n02" xrefstyle="select: label">Note 8.21 "It’s Not the Technology"</a> below).</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s03_p10">Mini networks that extend the conversation (NPR) or make it easier to find other rabidly loyal product fans (Harley-Davidson) may hold a niche for some firms. And Ning is a neat way for specialized groups to quickly form in a secure environment that’s all their own (it’s just us, no “creepy friends” from the other networks). While every market has a place for its niches, none of these will grow to compete with the dominant social networks. The value isn’t in the technology; it’s in what the technology has created over time. For Facebook, it’s a huge user base that (for now at least) is not going anywhere else.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s04_p02">While the authenticity and trust offered by Facebook was critical, offering News Feeds concentrated and released value from the social graph. With feeds, each time a user performs an activity in Facebook—makes a friend, uploads a picture, joins a group—the feed blasts this information to all of your friends in a reverse chronological list that shows up right when they next log on. An individual user’s activities are also listed on their profile. Get a new job, move to a new city, read a great article, have a pithy quote—post it to Facebook—the feed picks it up, and the world of your Facebook friends will get an update. Corporations love feeds, too! “Like” a firm on Facebook and the firm can post messages to your news feed, where you can “Like” new messages they send out, comment on them, and share the messages virally.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s04_p03">Feeds are perhaps the linchpin of Facebook’s ability to strengthen and deliver user value from the social graph, but for a brief period of time it looked like feeds would kill the company. News Feeds were launched on September 5, 2006, just as many of the nation’s undergrads were arriving on campus. Feeds reflecting any Facebook activity (including changes to the relationship status) became a sort of gossip page splashed right when your friends logged in. To many, feeds were first seen as a viral blast of digital nosiness—a release of information they hadn’t consented to distribute widely.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s04_p04">And in a remarkable irony, user disgust over the News Feed ambush offered a whip-crack demonstration of the power and speed of the feed virus. Facebook protest groups were formed on Facebook itself, and every student who, for example, joined a group named Students Against Facebook News Feed, had this fact blasted to their friends (along with a quick link where friends, too, could click to join the group). Hundreds of thousands of users mobilized against the firm in just twenty-four hours. It looked like Zuckerberg’s creation had turned on him, Frankenstein style.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s04_p05">The first official Facebook blog post on the controversy came off as a bit condescending (never a good tone to use when your customers feel that you’ve wronged them). “Calm down. Breathe. We hear you,” wrote Zuckerberg on the evening of September 5. The next post, three days after the News Feed launch, was much more contrite (“We really messed this one up,” he wrote). In an open letter, Zuckerberg apologized for the surprise, explaining how users could opt out of feeds. The tactic worked, and the controversy blew over.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_030">F. Vogelstein, “How Mark Zuckerberg Turned Facebook into the Web’s Hottest Platform,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, September 6, 2007.</span> The ability to stop personal information from flowing into the feed stream was just enough to stifle critics, and as it turns out, a lot of people really liked the feeds and found them useful. It soon became clear that if you wanted to use the Web to keep track of your social life and contacts, Facebook was the place to be. Not only did feeds not push users away, by the start of the next semester subscribers had nearly doubled! Facebook continues to refine feeds in several ways, including refining sharing into categories that include “Top Stories” that the site thinks you’ll be most interested in, “Recent News,” a “Ticker” for lighter content (e.g. music, games, location updates), and a “Timeline” that offers a sort of digital scrapbook of content that a user has shared online.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p02">In May 2007, Facebook followed News Feeds with another initiative that set it head and shoulders above its competition. At the firm’s first f8 (pronounced “fate”) Developers Conference, Mark Zuckerberg stood on stage and announced that he was opening up the screen real estate on Facebook to other application developers. Facebook published a set of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Programming hooks, or guidelines, published by firms that tell other programs how to get a service to perform a task such as send or receive data. For example, Amazon.com provides APIs to let developers write their own applications and Websites that can send the firm orders.</span></span> that specified how programs could be written to run within and interact with Facebook. Now any programmer could write an application that would live inside a user’s profile. Geeks of the world, Facebook’s user base could be yours! Just write something good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p03">Developers could charge for their wares, offer them for free, and even run ads. And Facebook let developers keep what they made (Facebook does revenue share with app vendors for some services, such as the Facebook Credits payment service, mentioned later). This was a key distinction; MySpace (a larger firm at the time) initially restricted developer revenue on the few products designed to run on their site, at times even blocking some applications. The choice was clear: Facebook had rolled out the welcome mat and developers flocked to the site.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p04">To promote the new apps, Facebook would run an Applications area on the site where users could browse offerings. Even better, News Feed was a viral injection that spread the word each time an application was installed. Your best friend just put up a slide show app? Maybe you’ll check it out, too. The predictions of $1 billion in social network ad spending were geek catnip, and legions of programmers came calling. Apps could be cobbled together on the quick, feeds made them spread like wildfire, and the early movers offered adoption rates never before seen by small groups of software developers. People began speaking of the Facebook Economy. Facebook was considered a platform. Some compared it to the next Windows, Zuckerberg the next Gates (hey, they both dropped out of Harvard, right?).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p05">And each application potentially added more value and features to the site without Facebook lifting a finger. The initial event launched with sixty-five developer partners and eighty-five applications. There were some missteps along the way. Some applications were accused of spamming friends with invites to install them (Facebook eventually put limits on viral communication from apps). There were also security concerns, privacy leaks, and apps that violated the intellectual property of other firms (see the “Errant Apps” sidebar below), but Facebook worked to quickly remove misbehaving apps, correct errors, improve the system, and encourage developers. Just one year in, Facebook had marshaled the efforts of some four hundred thousand developers and entrepreneurs, twenty-four thousand applications had been built for the platform, 140 new apps were being added each day, and 95 percent of Facebook members had installed at least one Facebook application. As Sarah Lacy, author of <em class="emphasis">Once You’re Lucky, Twice You’re Good</em>, put it, “with one masterstroke, Zuck had mobilized all of Silicon Valley to innovate for him.”</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p07">Once Facebook became a platform, Stanford professor BJ Fogg thought it would be a great environment for a programming class. In ten weeks his seventy-five students built a series of applications that collectively received over sixteen million installs. By the final week of class, several applications developed by students, including KissMe, Send Hotness, and Perfect Match, had received millions of users, and class apps collectively generated roughly a million dollars in ad revenue. At least three companies were formed from the course.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_103">M.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p08">But legitimate questions remain. Are Facebook apps really a big deal? Just how important will apps be to adding sustained value within Facebook? And how will firms leverage the Facebook framework to extract their own value? A chart from FlowingData showed the top category, Just for Fun, was larger than the next four categories combined. That suggests that a lot of applications are faddish time wasters. Yes, there is experimentation beyond virtual Zombie Bites. Visa has created a small business network on Facebook (Facebook had some eighty thousand small businesses online at the time of Visa’s launch). Educational software firm Blackboard offered an application that will post data to Facebook pages as soon as there are updates to someone’s Blackboard account (new courses, whether assignments or grades have been posted, etc.). We’re still a long way from Facebook as a Windows rival, but the platform helped push Facebook to number one, and it continues to deliver quirky fun (and then some) supplied by thousands of developers off its payroll.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Errant Apps and the Challenges of Running a Platform</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p09">Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, two brothers in Kolkata, India, who ran a modest software development company, decided to write a Scrabble clone as a Facebook application. The app, named Scrabulous, was social—users could invite friends to play, or they could search for new players looking for an opponent. Their application was a smash, snagging three million registered users and seven hundred thousand players a day after just a few months. Scrabulous was featured in <em class="emphasis">PC World</em>’s 100 best products of the year, received coverage in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, and was pulling in about twenty-five thousand dollars a month from online advertising. Way to go, little guys!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_036">H. Timmons, “Online Scrabble Craze Leaves Game Sellers at Loss for Words,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 2, 2008.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p10">There is only one problem: the Agarwalla brothers didn’t have the legal rights to Scrabble, and it was apparent to anyone that from the name to the tiles to the scoring—this was a direct rip-off of the well-known board game. Hasbro owns the copyright to Scrabble in the United States and Canada; Mattel owns it everywhere else. Thousands of fans joined Facebook groups with names like “Save Scrabulous” and “Please God, I Have So Little: Don’t Take Scrabulous, Too.” Users in some protest groups pledged never to buy Hasbro games if Scrabulous was stopped. Even if the firms wanted to succumb to pressure and let the Agarwalla brothers continue, they couldn’t. Both Electronic Arts and RealNetworks have contracted with the firms to create online versions of the game.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_p11">While the Facebook Scrabulous app is long gone, the tale serves to illustrate some of the challenges faced when creating a platform. In addition to copyright violations, app makers have crafted apps that annoy, purvey pornography, step over the boundaries of good taste, and raise privacy and security concerns. In fall 2010, the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> reported that unscrupulous partners had scraped personal information from the profiles of Facebook users and then sold the information to third parties—a violation of Facebook’s terms of service that created a firestorm in the media.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_104">J. Cheng, “Facebook Punishes App Developers Found Selling User Data,” <em class="emphasis">ArsTechnica</em>, November 1, 2010.</span> Zynga also ran into trouble and was skewered in the press when some of its partners were accused of scamming users into signing up for subscriptions or installing unwanted software in exchange for game credits (Zynga has since taken steps to screen partners and improve transparency).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_105">M. Arrington, “Zynga Takes Steps to Remove Scams from Games,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, November 2, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para">Firms from Facebook to Apple (through its iTunes Store) have struggled to find the right mix of monitoring, protection, and approval while avoiding cries of censorship and draconian control. Platform owners beware, developers can help you grow quickly and can deliver gobs of value, but misbehaving partners can create financial loss and brand damage and can sow mistrust.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s05_l02">
            <li>Facebook’s platform allows the firm to further leverage the network effect. Developers creating applications create complementary benefits that have the potential to add value to Facebook beyond what the firm itself provides to its users.</li>
            <li>There is no revenue-sharing mandate among platform partners—whatever an application makes can be kept by its developers (although Facebook does provide some services via revenue sharing, such as Facebook Credits).</li>
            <li>Most Facebook applications are focused on entertainment. The true, durable, long-term value of Facebook’s platform remains to be seen.</li>
            <li>Despite this, top app developers have found Facebook to be extraordinarily lucrative. Zynga is a multibillion-dollar firm, while Playfish and Playdom were acquired for hundreds of millions of dollars each.</li>
            <li>Running a platform can be challenging. Copyright, security, appropriateness, free speech tensions, efforts that tarnish platform operator brands, privacy, and the potential for competition with partners, all can make platform management more complex than simply creating a set of standards and releasing this to the public.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_p02">If Facebook is going to continue to give away its services for free, it needs to make money somehow. Right now the bulk of revenue comes from advertising. Fortunately for the firm, online advertising is hot. For years, online advertising has been the only major media category that has seen an increase in spending (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch08#fwk-38086-ch08" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 14 "Google in Three Parts: Search, Online Advertising, and Beyond"</a>). Firms spend more advertising online than they do on radio, magazine, cable television, or newspaper ads.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_037">D. Takahashi, “Internet Ads Finally Surpass Newspapers,” <em class="emphasis">VentureBeat</em>, April 14, 2011.</span> But not all Internet advertising is created equal. There are both signs that social networking sites are struggling to find the right ad model and trends suggesting that advertising on social networks could be a money-gushing bonanza.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_p03">Google founder Sergey Brin sums up early frustration with social media advertising, saying, “I don’t think we have the killer best way to advertise and monetize social networks yet,” that social networking ad inventory as a whole was proving problematic and that the “monetization work we were doing [in social media] didn’t pan out as well as we had hoped.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_038">“Everywhere and Nowhere,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, March 19, 2008.</span> When Google ad partner Fox Interactive Media (the News Corporation division that contains MySpace) announced that revenue would fall $100 million short of projections, News Corporation’s stock tumbled 5 percent, analysts downgraded the company, and the firm’s chief revenue officer was dismissed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_039">B. Stelter, “MySpace Might Have Friends, but It Wants Ad Money,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 16, 2008.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_p04">Why has advertising on social networking sites been such a tough nut for some to crack? Firms face two key challenges: <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_1e"><a class="glossterm">content adjacency</a><span class="glossdef">Concern that an advertisement will run near offensive material, embarrassing an advertiser and/or degrading their products or brands.</span></span> and user attention. The <em class="emphasis">content adjacency</em> problem refers to concern over where a firm’s advertisements will run. Consider all of the questionable titles in social networking news groups. Do advertisers really want their ads running alongside conversations that are racy, offensive, illegal, or that may even mock their products? This potential juxtaposition is a major problem with any site offering ads adjacent to free-form social media. Summing up industry wariness, one Procter &amp; Gamble manager said, “What in heaven’s name made you think you could monetize the real estate in which somebody is breaking up with their girlfriend?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_040">B. Stone, “Facebook Aims to Extends Its Reach across Web,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 1, 2008.</span>  An IDC report suggests that it’s because of content adjacency that “brand advertisers largely consider user-generated content as low-quality, brand-unsafe inventory” for running ads.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_041">R. Stross, “Advertisers Face Hurdles on Social Networking Sites,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 14, 2008.</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_p05">Now let’s look at the user attention problem.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Attention Challenges: The Hunt Versus The Hike</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s01_p01">In terms of revenue model, Facebook is radically different from Google and the hot-growth category of search advertising. Users of Google and other search sites are on a <em class="emphasis">hunt</em>—a task-oriented expedition to collect information that will drive a specific action. Search users want to learn something, buy something, research a problem, or get a question answered. To the extent that the hunt overlaps with ads, it works. Just searched on a medical term? Google will show you an ad from a drug company. Looking for a toy? You’ll see Google ads from eBay sellers and other online shops. Type in a vacation destination and you get a long list of ads from travel providers aggressively courting your spending. Even better, Google only charges text advertisers when a user clicks through. No clicks? The ad runs at no cost to the advertiser. From a return on investment perspective, this is extraordinarily efficient. How often do users click on Google ads? Enough for this to be the single most profitable activity among <em class="emphasis">any</em> Internet firm. In 2010, Google revenue topped $29 billion. Profits exceeded $8.5 billion, almost all of this from pay-per-click ads (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch08#fwk-38086-ch08" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 14 "Google in Three Parts: Search, Online Advertising, and Beyond"</a> for more details).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s01_p02">While users go to Google to hunt, they go to Facebook as if they were going on a <em class="emphasis">hike</em>—they have a rough idea of what they’ll encounter, but they’re there to explore and look around and enjoy the sights (or site). They’ve usually allocated time for fun, and they don’t want to leave the terrain when they’re having conversations, looking at photos or videos, and checking out updates from friends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s01_p03">These usage patterns are reflected in click-through rates. Google users click on ads around 2 percent of the time (and at a much higher rate when searching for product information). At Facebook, click-throughs are about 0.04 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_042">B. Urstadt, “The Business of Social Networks,” <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em>, July/August 2008. Rates quoted in this piece seem high, but a large discrepancy between site rates holds across reported data.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s01_p04">Most banner ads don’t charge per click but rather <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">CPM</a><span class="glossdef">Cost per thousand impressions (the M representing the roman numeral for one thousand).</span></span> (cost per thousand) <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impressions</a><span class="glossdef">Each time an ad is served to a user for viewing.</span></span> (each time an ad appears on someone’s screen). But Facebook banner ads performed so poorly that the firm pulled them in early 2010.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_043">C. McCarthy, “More Social, Please: Facebook Nixes Banner Ads,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, February 5, 2010.</span> Lookery, a one-time ad network that bought ad space on Facebook in bulk, had been reselling inventory at a CPM of 7.5 cents (note that Facebook does offer advertisers pay-per-click as well as impression-based, or CPM, options).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_044">B. Urstadt, “The Business of Social Networks,” <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em>, July/August 2008; J.

Lookery Lowers Its Guarantee to 7.5-cent CMPs,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, July 22, 2008.</span> By contrast, information and news-oriented sites do much better, particularly if these sites draw in a valuable and highly targeted audience. The social networking blog <em class="emphasis">Mashable</em> has CPM rates ranging between seven and thirty-three dollars. <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em> magazine boasts a CPM of seventy dollars. <em class="emphasis">TechTarget</em>, a Web publisher focusing on technology professionals, has been able to command CPM rates of one hundred dollars and above, fueling that firm’s IPO.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s02_p01">Facebook and other social networks are still learning what works, and Facebook, app firms, and advertisers have begun experimenting with all sorts of models. Many feel that Facebook has a unique opportunity to get consumers to engage with their brand, and some initial experiments point where this may be heading.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s02_p02">Many firms have been leveraging so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">engagement ads</a><span class="glossdef">Promotion technique popular with social media that attempts to get consumers to interact with an ad, then shares that action with friends.</span></span> by making their products part of the Facebook fun. Using an engagement ad, a firm can set up a promotion where a user can do things such as “Like” or become a fan of a brand, RSVP to an event and invite others, watch and comment on a video and see what your friends have to say, send a “virtual gift” with a personal message, or answer a question in a poll. The viral nature of Facebook allows actions to flow back into the news feed and spread among friends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s02_p03">COO Sheryl Sandberg discussed Ben &amp; Jerry’s promotion for the ice cream chain’s free cone day event. To promote the upcoming event, Ben &amp; Jerry’s initially contracted to make two hundred and fifty thousand “gift cones” available to Facebook users; they could click on little icons that would gift a cone icon to a friend, and that would show up in their profile. Within a couple of hours, customers had sent all two hundred and fifty thousand virtual cones. Delighted, Ben &amp; Jerry’s bought another two hundred and fifty thousand cones. Within eleven hours, half a million people had sent cones, many making plans with Facebook friends to attend the real free cone day. The day of the Facebook promotion, Ben &amp; Jerry’s Web site registered fifty-three million impressions, as users searched for store locations and wrote about their favorite flavors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_045">Q.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s02_p05">The news is filled with stories about employers scouring Facebook to screen potential hires. But one creative job seeker turned the tables and used Facebook to make it easier for firms to find him. Recent MBA graduate Eric Barker, a talented former screenwriter with experience in the film and gaming industry, bought ads promoting himself on Facebook, setting them up to run only on the screens of users identified as coming from firms he’d like to work for. In this way, someone Facebook identified as being from Microsoft would see an ad from Eric declaring “I Want to Be at Microsoft” along with an offer to click and learn more. The cost to run the ads was usually less than $5 a day. Said Barker, “I could control my bid price and set a cap on my daily spend. Starbucks put a bigger dent in my wallet than promoting myself online.” The ads got tens of thousands of impressions, hundreds of clicks, and dozens of people called offering assistance. Today, Eric Barker is gainfully employed at a “dream job” in the video game industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_048">Eric is a former student of mine.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s06_s02_p08">Consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) has been relentlessly experimenting with leveraging social networks for brand engagement, but the results show what a tough slog this can be. The firm did garner fourteen thousand Facebook “fans” for its Crest Whitestrips product, but those fans were earned while giving away free movie tickets and other promos. The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> quipped that with those kinds of incentives, “a hemorrhoid cream” could have attracted a similar group of “fans.” When the giveaways stopped, thousands promptly “unfanned” Whitestrips. Results for Procter &amp; Gamble’s “2X Ultra Tide” fan page were also pretty grim. P&amp;G tried offbeat appeals for customer-brand bonding, including asking Facebookers to post “their favorite places to enjoy stain-making moments.” But a check eleven months after launch had garnered just eighteen submissions, two from P&amp;G, two from staffers at spoof news site <em class="emphasis">The Onion</em>, and a bunch of short posts such as “Tidealicious!”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_053">R.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Facebook Ads: Massive Upside and Huge Growth</h2>
        <p class="para block">For all these challenges and limitations, it’s critical to underscore that Facebook advertising continues to grow at a <em class="emphasis">phenomenal rate</em>, and one that is strikingly similar to Google’s early ad growth trajectory.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_106">P. Kafka, “Facebook Isn’t Eating Google’s Lunch Yet, but It’s Getting Hungry…,” <em class="emphasis">AllThingsD</em>, March 13, 2011.</span> There are several reasons for this spectacular growth.</p>
        <p class="para block">First is the advertising appeal of <em class="emphasis">precise targeting</em>. Large advertising networks have tried to meticulously track users to develop a profile of their demographics, likes, and interests. At Facebook, the site knows all about you because you’ve told it the details—your age, the things you’re enthusiastic about, where you live, your relationship status. This opens up all sorts of targeting opportunities to even the smallest of advertisers. In one example, a wedding photography studio targeted ads at women aged 24 to 30 whose relationship status was engaged—that’s like sticking a flier in front of precisely everyone you want to reach and not wasting a dime on anyone else. The firm, CM Photographics, reports that just $600 in Facebook ads resulted in nearly $40,000 in revenue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_107">M. D’Onofrio, “Social Networking Sites Using New Advertising,” <em class="emphasis">BrandingIron</em>, November 18, 2010.</span></p>
        <p class="para block">Another key comes from leveraging <em class="emphasis">social engagement</em> in the ads themselves. Adding a “like” button to an ad allows firms to turn their advertising message into a trusted referral from users’ friends. Making ads more social allows advertisers to engage consumers to comment on content, RSVP to an event, and more. Many of these ads are designed to allow interaction within the ad that keeps them on the page so that users aren’t faced with a choice to deviate from their “hike.” And while user “Likes” and other updates might be lost in the constant scroll of the news feed, Facebook also lets advertisers pay to create sponsored stories, allowing advertisers to turn a member’s Facebook actions (status updates, check-ins, “likes”) into an ad on the right-side of the screen.</p>

You can now post status updates that show up in a user’s feed, allowing your message to appear in the same stream as postings from friends and to further spread virally. Users, of course, can turn off firm messages if they “unlike” a firm, and users are in control of their social ad participation through Facebook’s privacy settings, but this ability to connect to customers in a way that enables continued messaging and promotion is a huge draw for advertisers and gives Facebook ads a unique appeal that none of its rivals can match.</p>

                <li>Issues of content adjacency and user attention can make social networking ads less attractive than ads running alongside search and professionally produced content sites.</li>
                <li>Google enjoys significantly higher click-through rates than Facebook. Rates are lower since users of social sites are there to engage friends, not to hunt for products. They are less likely to be drawn away by clicks.</li>
                <li>Display ads are often charged based on impression. Social networks also offer lower CPM rates than many other, more targeted Web sites.</li>
                <li>Many firms have begun to experiment with engagement ads. While there have been some successes, engagement campaigns often haven’t yielded significant results</li>
                <li>Despite concern, Facebook ads have grown at a tremendous rate and are highly profitable.</li>
                <li>Facebook ads offer advantages of improved targeting and social engagement. Ads allow customers to endorse a firm’s offerings and to virally share a message with others. Facebook can leverage customer engagement in its own ads. And Facebook allows firms to continue to send messages to the news feeds of users who have “liked” their presence on Facebook.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p02">Conventional advertising may grow into a great business for Facebook, but the firm was clearly sitting on something that was unconventional compared to prior generations of Web services. Could the energy and virulent nature of social networks be harnessed to offer truly useful consumer information to its users? Word of mouth is considered the most persuasive (and valuable) form of marketing,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_054">V. Kumar, J. Andrew Petersen, and Robert Leone, “How Valuable Is Word of Mouth?” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 85, no. 10 (October 2007): 139—46.</span>   and Facebook was a giant word of mouth machine. What if the firm worked with vendors and grabbed consumer activity at the point of purchase to put it into the news feed and post it to a user’s profile? If you rented a video, bought a cool product, or dropped something in your wish list, your buddies could get a heads-up, and they might ask you about it. The person being asked feels like an expert, the person with the question gets a frank opinion, and the vendor providing the data just might get another sale. It looked like a home run.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p03">This effort, named Beacon, was announced in November 2007. Some forty e-commerce sites signed up, including Blockbuster, Fandango, eBay, Travelocity, Zappos, and the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>. Zuckerberg was so confident of the effort that he stood before a group of Madison Avenue ad executives and declared that Beacon would represent a “once-in-a-hundred-years” fundamental change in the way media works.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p04">Like News Feeds, user reaction was swift and brutal. The commercial activity of Facebook users began showing up without their consent. The biggest problem with Beacon was that it was “opt-out” instead of “opt-in.” Facebook (and its partners) assumed users would agree to sharing data in their feeds. A pop-up box did appear briefly on most sites supporting Beacon, but it disappeared after a few seconds.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_055">E. Nakashima, “Feeling Betrayed, Facebook Users Force Site to Honor Their Privacy,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, November 30, 2007.</span> Many users, blind to these sorts of alerts, either clicked through or ignored the warnings. And well…there are some purchases you might not want to broadcast to the world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p05">“Facebook Ruins Christmas for Everyone!” screamed one headline from MSNBC.com. Another from <em class="emphasis">U.S. News and World Report</em> read “How Facebook Stole Christmas.” The <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> ran the story of Sean Lane, a twenty-eight-year-old tech support worker from Waltham, Massachusetts, who got a message from his wife just two hours after he bought a ring on Overstock.com. “Who is this ring for?” she wanted to know. Facebook had not only posted a feed that her husband had bought the ring, but also that he got it for a 51 percent discount! Overstock quickly announced that it was halting participation in Beacon until Facebook changed its practice to opt in.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_056">E. Nakashima, “Feeling Betrayed, Facebook Users Force Site to Honor Their Privacy,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, November 30, 2007.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p06">MoveOn.org started a Facebook group and online petition protesting Beacon. The Center for Digital Democracy and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook’s advertising programs. And a Dallas woman sued Blockbuster for violating the Video Privacy Protection Act (a 1998 U.S. law prohibiting unauthorized access to video store rental records).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p07">To Facebook’s credit, the firm acted swiftly. Beacon was switched to an opt-in system, where user consent must be given before partner data is sent to the feed. Zuckerberg would later say regarding Beacon: “We’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_057">C. McCarthy, “Facebook’s Zuckerberg: ‘We Simply Did a Bad Job’ Handling Beacon,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, December 5, 2007.</span> Beacon was eventually shut down and $9.5 million was donated to various privacy groups as part of its legal settlement.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_058">J. Brodkin, “Facebook Shuts Down Beacon Program, Donates $9.5 Million to Settle Lawsuit,” <em class="emphasis">NetworkWorld</em>, December 8, 2009.</span> Despite the Beacon fiasco, new users continued to flock to the site, and loyal users stuck with Zuck. Perhaps a bigger problem was that many of those forty A-list e-commerce sites that took a gamble with Facebook now had their names associated with a privacy screw-up that made headlines worldwide. Not a good thing for one’s career. A manager so burned isn’t likely to sign up first for the next round of experimentation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_p08">From the Prada example in <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch01#fwk-38086-ch01" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 3 "Zara: Fast Fashion from Savvy Systems"</a> we learned that savvy managers look beyond technology and consider complete information systems—not just the hardware and software of technology but also the interactions among the data, people, and procedures that make up (and are impacted by) information systems. Beacon’s failure is a cautionary tale of what can go wrong if users fail to broadly consider the impact and implications of an information system on all those it can touch. Technology’s reach is often farther, wider, and more significantly impactful than we originally expect.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Predators and Privacy</h3>
        <p class="para">While spoiling Christmas is bad, sexual predators are far worse, and in October 2007, Facebook became an investigation target. Officials from the New York State Attorney General’s office had posed as teenagers on Facebook and received sexual advances. Complaints to the service from investigators posing as parents were also not immediately addressed. These were troubling developments for a firm that prided itself on trust and authenticity.</p>
        <p class="para">In a 2008 agreement with forty-nine states, Facebook offered a series of aggressive steps. Facebook agreed to respond to complaints about inappropriate content within twenty-four hours and to allow an independent examiner to monitor how it handles complaints. The firm imposed age-locking restrictions on profiles, reviewing any attempt by someone under the age of eighteen to change their date of birth. Profiles of minors were no longer searchable. The site agreed to automatically send a warning message when a child is at risk of revealing personal information to an unknown adult. And links to explicit material, the most offensive Facebook groups, and any material related to cyberbullying were banned.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reputation Damage, Increased Scrutiny, and Recovery—Learning from the Facebook TOS Debacle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_s01_p01">Facebook also suffered damage to its reputation, brand, and credibility, further reinforcing perceptions that the company acts brazenly, without considering user needs, and is fast and loose on privacy and user notification. Facebook worked through the feeds outrage, eventually convincing users of the benefits of feeds. But Beacon was a fiasco. And now users, the media, and watchdogs were on the alert.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_s01_p02">When the firm modified its terms of service (TOS) policy in spring 2009, the uproar was immediate. As a cover story in <em class="emphasis">New York</em> magazine summed it up, Facebook’s new TOS appeared to state, “We can do anything we want with your content, forever,” even if a user deletes their account and leaves the service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_059">V. Grigoriadis, “Do You Own Facebook? Or Does Facebook Own You?” <em class="emphasis">New York</em>, April 5, 2009.</span>  Yet <em class="emphasis">another</em> privacy backlash!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_s01_p03">Activists organized; the press crafted juicy, attention-grabbing headlines; and the firm was forced once again to backtrack. But here’s where others can learn from Facebook’s missteps and response. The firm was contrite and reached out to explain and engage users. The old TOS were reinstated, and the firm posted a proposed new version that gave the firm broad latitude in leveraging user content without claiming ownership. And the firm renounced the right to use this content if a user closed their Facebook account. This new TOS was offered in a way that solicited user comments, and it was submitted to a community vote, considered binding if 30 percent of Facebook users participated. Zuckerberg’s move appeared to have turned Facebook into a democracy and helped empower users to determine the firm’s next step.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_s01_p04">Despite the uproar, only about 1 percent of Facebook users eventually voted on the measure, but the 74 percent to 26 percent ruling in favor of the change gave Facebook some cover to move forward.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_060">J. Smith, “Facebook TOS Voting Concludes, Users Vote for New Revised Documents,” <em class="emphasis">Inside Facebook</em>, April 23, 2009.</span> This event also demonstrates that a tempest can be generated by a relatively small number of passionate users. Firms ignore the vocal and influential at their own peril!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s07_s01_p05">In Facebook’s defense, the broad TOS was probably more a form of legal protection than any nefarious attempt to exploit all user posts ad infinitum. The U.S. legal environment does require that explicit terms be defined and communicated to users, even if these are tough for laypeople to understand. But a “trust us” attitude toward user data doesn’t work, particularly for a firm considered to have committed ham-handed gaffes in the past. Managers must learn from the freewheeling Facebook community. In the era of social media, your actions are now subject to immediate and sustained review. Violate the public trust, and expect the equivalent of a high-powered investigative microscope examining your every move and a very public airing of the findings.</p>
        <p class="para block">For Facebook, that microscope will be in place for at least the next two decades. In a late 2011 deal with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Facebook settled a series of governmental inquiries related to issues such as the ones outlined above—events that Zuckerberg admits added up to “a bunch of mistakes” made by the firm. Facebook agreed to undergo twenty years of regular third-party privacy audits, and to a host of additional restrictions that include getting users’ consent before making privacy changes, and making content from deleted profiles unavailable after 30 days. If Facebook fails to comply with these terms, it will face fines of $16,000 per violation per day.<span class="footnote" id="e261.fwk-38086-fn07_100">L.

                <li> Word of mouth is the most powerful method for promoting products and services, and Beacon was conceived as a giant word-of-mouth machine with win-win benefits for firms, recommenders, recommendation recipients, and Facebook. </li>
                <li> Beacon failed because it was an opt-out system that was not thoroughly tested beforehand and because user behavior, expectations, and system procedures were not completely taken into account. </li>

                <li> Facebook also reinforced negative perceptions regarding the firm’s attitudes toward users, notifications, and their privacy. This attitude only served to focus a continued spotlight on the firm’s efforts, and users became even less forgiving. </li>
                <li> Activists and the media were merciless in criticizing the firm’s terms of service changes. Facebook’s democratizing efforts demonstrate lessons other organizations can learn from, regarding user scrutiny, public reaction, and stakeholder engagement. </li>

    <p class="para block">In spring 2010, the world got a sense of the breadth and depth of Mark Zuckerberg’s vision. During the firm’s annual f8 Developers Conference, Facebook launched a series of initiatives referred to as Open Graph that placed the company directly at the center of identity, sharing, and personalization—not just on Facebook but also across the Web.</p>
    <p class="para block">With just a few lines of HTML code, any developer could add a Facebook “Like” button to their site and take advantage of the social network’s power of viral distribution. A user clicking that page’s “Like” button automatically would then send a link to that page to their news feed, where it has the potential to be seen by all of their friends. No additional sign-in is necessary as long as you logged into Facebook first (reinforcing Facebook’s importance as the first stop in your Internet surfing itinerary). While some sites renamed “Like” to “Recommend” (after all, do you really want to “like” a story about a disaster or tragedy?), the effort was adopted with stunning speed. Facebook’s “Like” button served up more than one billion times across the Web in the first twenty-four hours, and over fifty thousand Web sites signed up to add the “Like” button to their content within the first week.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_062">A. Oreskovic, “Facebook Efforts Hint at Growing Ad Clout,” <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em>, April 30, 2010.</span></p>
    <p class="para block">Facebook also offered a system where Web site operators can choose to accept a user’s Facebook credentials for logging in. Users like this because they can access content without the hurdle of creating a new account. Web sites like it because with the burden of signing up out of the way, Facebook becomes an experimentation lubricant: “Oh, I can use my Facebook ID to sign in? Then let me try this out.”</p>
    <p class="para block">Facebook also lets Web sites embed some Facebook functionality right on their pages. A single line of code added to any page creates a “social toolbar” that shows which of your patrons are logged into Facebook, and allows access to Facebook Chat without leaving that site. Site operators who are keen on making it easy for patrons to summon friends to their pages can now sprinkle these little bits of Facebook across the Web.</p>
    <p class="para block">Other efforts allow firms to leverage Facebook data to make their sites more personalized. Firms around the Web can now show if a visitor’s friends have “Liked” items on the site, posted comments, or performed other actions. Using this feature, Facebook users logging into Yelp can see a list of restaurants recommended by trusted friends instead of just the reviews posted by a bunch of strangers. Users of the music-streaming site Pandora can have the service customized based on music tastes pulled from their Facebook profile page. They can share stations with friends and have data flow back to update the music preferences listed in their Facebook profile pages. Visit CNN and the site can pull together a list of stories recommended by friends.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_063">J. Valentino-DeVries, “Facebook CEO Zuckerberg on Plans to Dominate the Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, April 21, 2010.</span> Think about how this strengthens the social graph. While items in the news feed might quickly scroll away and disappear, that data can now be pulled up within a Web site, providing insight from friends when and where you’re likely to want it most.</p>
    <p class="para block">Taken together, these features enlist Web sites to serve as vassal states in the Facebook empire. Each of these ties makes Facebook membership more valuable by enhancing network effects, strengthening switching costs, and creating larger sets of highly personalized data to leverage.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Facebook: The Bank of the Web?</h3>
        <p class="para">Those with an eye for business disruption are watching the evolution of Facebook Credits. Credits can be used to pay for items, such as features and enhancements in video games or virtual gifts. Facebook shares Credits revenue with application developers, taking a sizeable 30 percent off the top for acting as banker and transaction clearing house. That’s a steep price to pay, but a unified standard may also prompt innovation since users are far more likely to trust Facebook with their credit card than to register their card on multiple services run by little-known app developers. As of July 2011, Facebook Credits are the mandatory in-game currency for all developers on the service.</p>
        <p class="para">There are real bucks to be made from digital make-believe. Analysts estimate that in 2010, virtual goods racked up an estimated $1.6 billion in U.S. transactions and $7.3 billion worldwide.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_064">D. Reisinger, “Virtual Goods Revenue to Hit $7.3 Billion This Year,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, November 15, 2010; D.

Kincaid, “Facebook to Make ‘Facebook Credits’ Mandatory for Game Developers (Confirmed),” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, January 24, 2011.</span> There are also an increasing number of ways to pay for Credits. Facebook’s App2Credits effort lets firms offer Credits in ways that don’t involve a credit card, including getting Credits as part of a card loyalty program, converting unwanted real-world gift cards into Facebook Credits, or earning Credits for shopping or performing other online tasks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_065">J. Kincaid, “A Look at the Future of Facebook Credits,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, April 21, 2010.</span></p>
        <p class="para">Credits were rolled out supporting fifteen international currencies and multiple credit cards.

McCarthy, “Facebook to Developers: Get Ready for Credits,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, February 25, 2010.</span> Credits can also be redeemed for vouchers that can be used to buy real-world products and services offered via the Facebook Deals platform.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_115">M. Ingram, “Facebook’s Two Deal Weapons: The Social Graph and Credits,” <em class="emphasis">GigaOM</em>, April 26, 2011.</span></p>
        <p class="para">All this banking activity leaves some wondering if Facebook might not have grander ambitions. The <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em> has referred to Facebook as being on the path to becoming “The Bank of the Web.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_067">C. Nuttall, “Facebook Credits Bank of the Web,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Times</em>, April 23, 2010.</span> Could Facebook morph into an actual real-currency bank? A site that knows how to reach your friends might offer an easy way to, say, settle a dinner tab or hound buddies for their Final Four pool money. This might also be a solid base for even deeper banking links between users and all those firms Facebook has begun to leverage in deeper data-sharing partnerships. This may be something to think about, or perhaps, to bank on!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Open Graph and Privacy Controversy</h2>
        <p class="para block">The decision to launch many of the new Open Graph features as “opt-out” instead of “opt-in” immediately drew the concern of lawmakers. Given the Beacon debacle, the TOS controversy, and Google’s problems with Buzz (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch08#fwk-38086-ch08" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 14 "Google in Three Parts: Search, Online Advertising, and Beyond"</a>), you’d think Facebook would have known better. But within a week of Open Graph’s launch, four U.S. senators contacted the firm, asking why it was so difficult to opt out of the information-sharing platform.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_068">F. Lardinois, “Is It Time for Facebook to Make Opt-In the Default?” <em class="emphasis">Read Write Web</em>, April 27, 2010.</span> Amid a crush of negative publicity, the firm was forced to quickly roll out simplified privacy management controls.</p>
        <p class="para block">Facebook’s struggles show the tension faced by any firm that wants to collect data to improve the user experience (and hopefully make money along the way). Opt-out guarantees the largest possible audience and that’s key to realizing the benefits of network effects, data, and scale. Making efforts opt-in creates the very real risk that not enough users will sign up and that the reach and impact of these kinds of initiatives will be limited.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_069">F. Lardinois, “Is It Time for Facebook to Make Opt-In the Default?” <em class="emphasis">Read Write Web</em>, April 27, 2010.</span> <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em> calls this the <em class="emphasis">paradox of privacy</em>, saying, “We want some semblance of control over our personal data, even if we likely can’t be bothered to manage it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_070">F. Manjoo, “Does Privacy on Facebook, Google, and Twitter Even Matter?” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, May 1, 2010.</span> Evidence suggests that most people are accepting some degree of data sharing as long as they know that they can easily turn it off if they want to. For example, when Google rolled out ads that tracked users across the network of Web sites running Google ads, the service also provided a link in each ad where users could visit an “ad preferences manager” to learn how they were being profiled, to change settings, and to opt out (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch08#fwk-38086-ch08" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 14 "Google in Three Parts: Search, Online Advertising, and Beyond"</a>). It turns out only one in fifteen visitors to the ad preferences manager ended up opting out completely.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_071">F. Manjoo, “Does Privacy on Facebook, Google, and Twitter Even Matter?” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, May 1, 2010.</span> Managers seeking to leverage data should learn from the examples of Facebook and Google and be certain to offer clear controls that empower user choice.</p>

And it’s not just employers. Sleuths at universities and police departments have begun looking to Facebook for evidence of malfeasance. Oxford University fined graduating students more than £10,000 for their postexam celebrations, evidence of which was picked up from Facebook. Police throughout the United States have made underage drinking busts and issued graffiti warnings based on Facebook photos, too. Beware—the Web knows!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Open Graph and Strategic Concerns: Asset Strength, Free Riders, and Security</h2>
        <p class="para block">Facebook also allows third-party developers to create all sorts of apps to access Facebook data. Facebook feeds are now streaming through devices that include Samsung, Vizio, and Sony televisions; Xbox 360 and Wii game consoles; Verizon’s FiOS pay television service; and the Amazon Kindle. While Facebook might never have the time or resources to create apps that put its service on every gadget on the market, they don’t need to. Developers using Facebook’s access tools will gladly pick up the slack.</p>
        <p class="para block">But there are major challenges with a more open approach, most notably a weakening of strategic assets, revenue sharing, and security. First, let’s discuss weakened assets. Mark Zuckerberg’s geeks have worked hard to make their site the top choice for most of the world’s social networkers and social network application developers. Right now, everyone goes to Facebook because everyone else is on Facebook. But as Facebook opens up access to users and content, it risks supporting efforts that undermine the firm’s two most compelling sources of competitive advantage: network effects and switching costs. Any effort that makes it easier to pack up your “social self” and move it elsewhere risks undermining vital competitive resources advantages (it still remains more difficult to export contacts, e-mails, photos, and video from Facebook than it does from sites supporting OpenSocial, a rival platform backed by Google and supported by many of Facebook’s competitors).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_072">F. Vogelstein, “The Great Wall of Facebook,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, July 2009.</span> This situation also puts more pressure on Facebook to behave. Lower those switching costs at a time when users are disgusted with firm behavior, and it’s not inconceivable that a sizable chunk of the population could bolt for a new rival (to Facebook’s credit, the site also reached out to prior critics like MoveOn.org, showing Facebook’s data-sharing features and soliciting input months before their official release).</p>
        <p class="para block">Along with asset weakening comes the issue of revenue sharing. As mentioned earlier, hosting content (especially photos and rich media) is a very expensive proposition. What incentive does a site have to store data if it will just be sent to a third-party site that will run ads around this content and not share the take? Too much data portability presents a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">free rider problem</a><span class="glossdef">When others take advantage of a user or service without providing any sort of reciprocal benefit.</span></span> where firms mooch off Facebook’s infrastructure without offering much in return. Consider services like TweetDeck (now owned by Twitter). The free application allows users to access their Facebook feeds and post status updates—alongside Twitter updates and more—all from one interface. Cool for the user, but bad for Facebook, since each TweetDeck use means Facebook users are “off-site,” not looking at ads, and hence not helping Zuckerberg &amp; Co. earn revenue. It’s as if the site has encouraged the equivalent of an ad blocker, yet Facebook’s openness lets this happen!</p>
        <p class="para block">Finally, consider security. Allowing data streams that contain potentially private posts and photographs to squirt across the Internet and land where you want them raises all sorts of concerns. What’s to say an errant line of code doesn’t provide a back door to your address book or friends list? To your messaging account? To let others see photos you’d hoped to only share with family? Security breaches can occur on any site, but once the data is allowed to flow freely, every site with access is, for hackers, the equivalent of a potential door to open or a window to crawl through.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s08_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Social Networking Goes Global</h3>
            <p class="para">Facebook will eventually see stellar growth start to slow as the law of large numbers sets in. The shift from growth business to mature one can be painful, and for online firms it can occur relatively quickly. That doesn’t mean these firms will become unprofitable, but to sustain growth (particularly important for keeping up the stock price of a publicly traded company), firms often look to expand abroad.</p>
            <p class="para">Facebook’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crowdsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">The act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent (usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an undefined generally large group of people in the form of an open call.</span></span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">localization</a><span class="glossdef">Adapting products and services for different languages and regional differences.</span></span> effort, where users were asked to look at Facebook phrases and offer translation suggestions for their local language (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch06#fwk-38086-ch06" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 7 "Social Media, Peer Production, and Web 2.0"</a>), helped the firm rapidly deploy versions in dozens of markets, blasting the firm past MySpace in global reach. But network effects are both quick and powerful, and late market entry can doom a business reliant on the positive feedback loop of a growing user base.</p>
            <p class="para">And global competition is out there. Worldwide, Facebook wannabes include Vkontakte (“in contact”), Russia’s most popular social networking site; Google’s Orkut (which is tops in Brazil, although Facebook’s gaining there, too); and Renren (formerly Xiaonei), which is said to have registered 90 percent of China’s college students.</p>
            <p class="para">China is proving a particularly difficult market for foreign Internet firms. Google, eBay, Yahoo! and MySpace have all struggled there (at one point, Rupert Murdoch even sent his wife, Wendi Deng Murdoch, to head up the MySpace China effort). And don’t be surprised to see some of these well-capitalized overseas innovators making a move on U.S. markets too.</p>
            <p class="para">While global growth can seem like a good thing, acquiring global users isn’t the same as making money from them. Free sites with large amounts of users from developing nations face real cost/revenue challenges. As the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> points out, there are 1.6 billion Internet users worldwide, but fewer than half of them have disposable incomes high enough to interest major advertisers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_073">B. Stone and M. Helft, “In Developing Countries, Web Grows without Profit,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 27, 2009.</span> Worse still, telecommunications costs in these markets are also often higher, too. Bandwidth costs and dim revenue options caused video site Veoh to block access coming from Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and some parts of Asia. MySpace already offers a stripped-down Lite option as its default in India. And execs at YouTube and Facebook haven’t ruled out lowering the quality of streaming media, file size, or other options, discriminating by region or even by user.</p>
            <p class="para">Making money in the face of this so-called “International Paradox” requires an awareness of “fast and cheap” tech trends highlighted in <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch04#fwk-38086-ch04" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 5 "Moore’s Law: Fast, Cheap Computing and What It Means for the Manager"</a>, as well as an ability to make accurate predictions regarding regional macroeconomic trends. Ignore a market that’s unprofitable today and a rival could swoop in and establish network effects and other assets that are unbeatable tomorrow. But move too early and losses could drag you down.</p>
            <p class="para">Concerns aren’t just financial; they’re also political and ethical. Facebook is officially banned in China (although many Chinese have used technical work-arounds to access the site), and Zuckerberg is clearly interested in the Chinese market. He spends an hour each day learning Chinese and has made several trips to China, as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_116">L. Horn, “Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg Visits China’s Top Search Engine,” <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, December 20, 2010.</span> Facebook has discussed a partnership with China’s dominant search site, Baidu, but moving forward with an effort that complies with China’s filtering requirements leaves executives conflicted. Some say even a censored Facebook would be a catalyst for Chinese democratic reform, while others see this as a compromise of the firm’s belief in the power of exchange and promoting the free flow of information. Says the firm’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, “There are compromises on not being in China, and there are compromises on being in China. It’s not clear to me which one is bigger.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_117">B.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_p03">While the valuations of private firms are notoriously difficult to pin down due to a lack of financial disclosure, the $15 billion valuation Facebook received after accepting the fall 2007 Microsoft investment was rich, even when made by such a deep-pocketed firm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_p05">But now that investment looks like a steal. The chart of Facebook’s estimated value has risen like a hockey stick. On secondary markets for private shares, such as SharesPost and SecondMarket, Facebook has traded at a value of $70 billion, and a <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> report pegged the firm as possibly worth $100 billion or more—a value that would put it ahead of tech giants like Amazon and Cisco.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_118">G.

    <p class="para block">Facebook faces pressure to go public soon because under U.S. SEC rules, any private company with more than 499 shareholders must disclose its financials, and an early 2011 investment in Facebook by Goldman Sachs, made on behalf of multiple Goldman clients, prompted an investigation as to whether or not Facebook had already crossed that threshold.<span class="footnote" id="e394.fwk-38086-fn07_119">“Facebook’s Future on the Open Market,” <em class="emphasis">Knowledge@Wharton</em>, May 25, 2011.</span> If a firm needs to make its financials public (exposing details of its business to competitors), then why not go to the public markets and raise money to grow faster?

    <p class="para block">When considering a firm’s value it’s also important to realize that just because the market is willing to pay a high price for a firm’s stock doesn’t mean the firm is worth it. A firm’s stock price is supposed to reflect the net present value of a firm’s future earnings, and unrealistic expectations can distort value. Shortly after LinkedIn’s IPO, many questioned that firm’s sky-high valuation,<span class="footnote" id="e395.fwk-38086-fn07_121">S. Zhu, “LinkedIn’s Valuation Is Unjustifiable,” <em class="emphasis">SeekingAlpha</em>, May 30, 2011.</span> and the bubble period before the crash of 2000 was fueled largely by excess euphoria over the prospects of high-technology firms.</p>

        <p class="para">While Facebook has, at times, been the Web’s most visited destination, its user base generates far less cash on a per-person basis than many rivals do, including only about one-sixth of Google’s per-user figure.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_077">J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_p08">Much remains to be demonstrated for any high Facebook valuation to hold over the long term. Facebook is still a relative youngster. Its models are evolving, and it has quite a bit to prove. As the chart in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38086-ch07_s10_f01" xrefstyle="select: label">Figure 8.4 "Revenue per User (2011)"</a> shows, Facebook still lags well behind many of its rivals in terms of revenue per user. Also consider the uncertainty as the firm tries to leverage the social graph. According to Facebook’s own research, “an average Facebook user with 500 friends actively follows the news on only forty of them, communicates with twenty, and keeps in close touch with about ten. Those with smaller networks follow even fewer.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn07_079">S. Baker, “Learning and Profiting from Online Friendships,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, May 21, 2009.</span> That might not be enough critical mass to offer real, differentiable value to paying advertisers, and interest in deepening connections among users with “value-shallow” social graphs may in part have motivated Facebook’s mishandled attempts to encourage more public data sharing. The advantages of leveraging the friend network hinge on increased sharing and trust, a challenge for a firm that has had so many high-profile privacy stumbles.</p>
    <p class="para block">Even with uncertainty, though, Facebook’s growth thus far does seem to offer a lot of runway for expansion. Up to this point all of Facebook’s solidly accelerating ad revenue has been derived from serving ads on Facebook.com. But Google earns about 30 percent of its revenue from serving ads on third-party Web sites, splitting the take with site operators (this is referred to as running an ad network). If Facebook takes its targeting technology to the Web and creates its own ad network for other Web sites to join, then that would have the potential to add more rocket fuel to the Facebook revenue moon shot. Where else could Facebook go to seek profits? Zuckerberg has said that music and television are social frontiers as well. Facebook TV, anyone? Facebook Radio?<span class="footnote" id="e398.fwk-38086-fn07_122">M. Campbell and J. Browning, “Facebook’s Zuckerberg Says Music, TV Are Social Frontiers,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg</em>, May 25, 2011.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_p09">Steve Rubel wrote the following on his Micro Persuasion blog: “The Internet amber is littered with fossilized communities that once dominated. These former stalwarts include AOL, Angelfire, theGlobe.com, GeoCities, and Tripod.” Network effects and switching cost advantages can be strong, but not necessarily insurmountable if value is seen elsewhere and if an effort becomes more fad than “must have.” Time will tell if Facebook’s competitive assets and constant innovation are enough to help it avoid the fate of those that have gone before them.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_l02">
            <li>Not all investments are created equal, and a simple calculation of investment dollars multiplied by the percentage of firm owned does not tell the whole story.</li>
            <li>Microsoft’s investment entitled the firm to preferred shares; it also came with advertising deal exclusivity.</li>
            <li>Microsoft may also benefit from offering higher valuations that discourage rivals from making acquisition bids for Facebook.</li>
            <li>Facebook has continued to invest capital raised in expansion, particularly in hardware and infrastructure. It has also pursued its own acquisitions, including a failed bid to acquire Twitter.</li>
            <li>The firm’s success will hinge on its ability to create sustainably profitable revenue opportunities. It has yet to prove that data from the friend network will be large enough and can be used in a way that is differentiably attractive to advertisers. However, some experiments in profiling and ad targeting across a friend network have shown very promising results. Firms exploiting these opportunities will need to have a deft hand in offering consumer and firm value while quelling privacy concerns.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch07_s10_l03">
            <li>Circumstances change over time. Research the current state of Facebook’s financials—how much is the firm “valued at”? How much revenue does it bring in? How profitable is it? Are these figures easy or difficult to find? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Who else might want to acquire Facebook? Is it worth it at current valuation rates?</li>
            <li>What motivation does Microsoft have in bidding so much for Facebook?</li>
            <li>Do you think Facebook was wise to take funds from Digital Sky? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Do you think Facebook’s friend network is large enough to be leveraged as a source of revenue in ways that are notably different than conventional pay-per-click or CPM-based advertising? Would you be excited about certain possibilities? Creeped out by some? Explain possible scenarios that might work or might fail. Justify your interpretation of these scenarios.</li>
            <li>So you’ve had a chance to learn about Facebook, its model, growth, outlook, strategic assets, and competitive environment. How much do you think the firm is worth? Which firms do you think it should compare with in terms of value, influence, and impact? Would you invest in Facebook?</li>
            <li>Which firms might make good merger partners with Facebook? Would these deals ever go through? Why or why not?</li>
