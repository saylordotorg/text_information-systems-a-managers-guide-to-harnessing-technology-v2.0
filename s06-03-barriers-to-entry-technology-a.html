    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p02">Some have correctly argued that the barriers to entry for many tech-centric businesses are low. This argument is particularly true for the Internet where rivals can put up a competing Web site or deploy a rival app seemingly overnight. But it’s absolutely critical to understand that market entry is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as building a sustainable business and just showing up doesn’t guarantee survival.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p03">Platitudes like “follow, don’t lead”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_036">N. Carr, “IT 
Doesn’t Matter,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 81, no. 5 (May 2003): 41—49.</span>  can put firms dangerously at risk, and statements about low entry barriers ignore the difficulty many firms will have in matching the competitive advantages of successful tech pioneers. Should Blockbuster have waited while Netflix pioneered? In a year where Netflix profits were up seven-fold, Blockbuster lost more than $1 billion, and today Blockbuster is bankrupt.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_037">“Movies to Go,” <em class="emphasis">Economist</em>, July 9, 2005.</span>  Should Sotheby’s have dismissed seemingly inferior eBay? Sotheby’s made $96 million in 2010, but eBay earned over $1.8 billion. Barnes &amp; Noble waited seventeen months to respond to Amazon.com. Amazon now has 32 times the profits of its offline rival, and its market cap is roughly 140 times greater.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_038">FY 2010 net income and March 26, 2011, market cap figures for both firms.</span>  Rival Borders has already declared bankruptcy. Today’s Internet giants are winners because in most cases, they were the first to move with a profitable model and they were able to quickly establish resources for competitive advantage. With few exceptions, established offline firms have failed to catch up to today’s Internet leaders.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p04">Timing and technology alone will not yield sustainable competitive advantage. Yet both of these can be <em class="emphasis">enablers</em> for competitive advantage. Put simply, it’s not the time lead or the technology; it’s what a firm <em class="emphasis">does</em> with its time lead and technology. True strategic positioning means that a firm has created differences that cannot be easily matched by rivals. Moving first pays off when the time lead is used to create critical resources that are valuable, rare, tough to imitate, and lack substitutes. Anything less risks the arms race of operational effectiveness. Build resources like brand, scale, network effects, switching costs, or other key assets and your firm may have a shot. But guess wrong about the market or screw up execution and failure or direct competition awaits. It is true that most tech can be copied—there’s little magic in eBay’s servers, Intel’s processors, Oracle’s databases, or Microsoft’s operating systems that past rivals have not at one point improved upon. But the lead that each of these tech-enabled firms had was leveraged to create network effects, switching costs, data assets, and helped build solid and well-respected brands.</p>

        <h3 class="title">But Google Arrived Late! Why Incumbents Must Constantly Consider Rivals</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p05">Although its share is slowly eroding, Yahoo! has been able to hold onto its lead in e-mail for so long because the firm quickly matched and nullified Gmail’s most significant tech-based innovations before Google could inflict real damage. Perhaps Yahoo! had learned from prior errors. The firm’s earlier failure to respond to Google’s emergence as a credible threat in search advertising gave Sergey Brin and Larry Page the time they needed to build the planet’s most profitable Internet firm.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p06">Yahoo! (and many Wall Street analysts) saw search as a commodity—a service the firm had subcontracted out to other firms including Alta Vista and Inktomi. Yahoo! saw no conflict in taking an early investment stake in Google or in using the firm for its search results. But Yahoo! failed to pay attention to Google’s advance. As Google’s innovations in technology and interface remained unmatched over time, this allowed the firm to build its brand, scale, and advertising network (distribution channel) that grew from network effects because content providers and advertisers attract one another. These are all competitive resources that rivals have never been able to match.</p>
        <p class="para">Now Google (and Apple, too) are once again running from this playbook—turning the smartphone software market into what increasingly looks like a two-horse race. Many rivals, including Microsoft, had been trying to create a mobile standard for years, but their technical innovations offered little durable strategic value. It wasn’t until app stores flourished, offered with a high-quality user experience, that dominant smartphone platforms emerged. Yes, Google and Apple arrived late, but nothing before them had created defensible strategic assets, and that left an opening.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p07">Google’s ability to succeed after being late to the search and mobile party isn’t a sign of the power of the late mover; it’s a story about the failure of incumbents to monitor their competitive landscape, recognize new rivals, and react to challenging offerings. That doesn’t mean that incumbents need to respond to every potential threat. Indeed, figuring out which threats are worthy of response is the real skill here. Video rental chain Hollywood Video wasted over $300 million in an Internet streaming business years before high-speed broadband was available to make the effort work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_039">N. Wingfield, “Netflix vs. the Naysayers,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, March 21, 2007.</span> But while Blockbuster avoided the balance sheet—cratering gaffes of Hollywood Video, the firm also failed to respond to Netflix—a new threat that had timed market entry perfectly (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch03#fwk-38086-ch03" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 4 "Netflix in Two Acts: The Making of an E-commerce Giant and the Uncertain Future of Atoms to Bits"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_p08">Firms that quickly get to market with the “right” model can dominate, but it’s equally critical for leading firms to pay close attention to competition and innovate in ways that customers value. Take your eye off the ball and rivals may use time and technology to create strategic resources. Just look at Friendster—a firm that was once known as the largest social network in the United States but has fallen so far behind rivals that it has become virtually irrelevant today.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_l02">
            <li>It doesn’t matter if it’s easy for new firms to enter a market if these newcomers can’t create and leverage the assets needed to challenge incumbents.</li>
            <li>Beware of those who say, “IT doesn’t matter” or refer to the “myth” of the first mover. This thinking is overly simplistic. It’s not a time or technology lead that provides sustainable competitive advantage; it’s what a firm does with its time and technology lead. If a firm can use a time and technology lead to create valuable assets that others cannot match, it may be able to sustain its advantage. But if the work done in this time and technology lead can be easily matched, then no advantage can be achieved, and a firm may be threatened by new entrants</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s03_l03">
            <li>Does technology lower barriers to entry or raise them? Do low entry barriers necessarily mean that a firm is threatened?</li>
            <li>Is there such a thing as the first-mover advantage? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Why did Google beat Yahoo! in search?</li>
            <li>A former editor of the <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, Nick Carr, once published an article in that same magazine with the title “IT Doesn’t Matter.” In the article he also offered firms the advice: “Follow, Don’t Lead.” What would you tell Carr to help him improve the way he thinks about the relationship between time, technology, and competitive advantage?</li>
            <li>Name an early mover that has successfully defended its position. Name another that had been superseded by the competition. What factors contributed to its success or failure?</li>
            <li>You have just written a word processing package far superior in features to Microsoft Word. You now wish to form a company to market it. List and discuss the barriers your start-up faces.</li>
            <li>What kinds of strategic assets are Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS seeking to create and exploit? Do you think these firms will be more successful than rivals? Why or why not?</li>
