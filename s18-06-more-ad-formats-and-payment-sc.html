    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p02">Online ads aren’t just about text ads billed in CPC. Ads running through Google AdSense, through its DoubleClick subsidiary, or on most competitor networks can be displayed in several formats and media types, and can be billed in different ways. The specific ad formats supported depend on the ad network but can include the following: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">image (or display) ads</a><span class="glossdef">Graphical advertising (as opposed to text ads).</span></span> (such as horizontally oriented banners, smaller rectangular buttons, and vertically oriented “skyscraper” ads); <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rich media ads</a><span class="glossdef">Online ads that include animation, audio, or video.</span></span> (which can include animation or video); and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interstitials</a><span class="glossdef">Ads that run before a user arrives at a Web site’s contents.</span></span> (ads that run before a user arrives at a Web site’s contents). The industry trade group, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB)</a><span class="glossdef">A nonprofit industry trade group for the interactive advertising industry. The IAB evaluates and recommends interactive advertising standards and practices and also conducts research, education, and legislative lobbying.</span></span> sets common standards for display ads so that a single creative (the design and content of the advertisement) can run unmodified across multiple ad networks and Web sites.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_036">See Interactive Advertising Bureau Ad Unit Guidelines for details at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452">http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p03">And there are lots of other ways ads are sold besides cost-per-click. Most graphical display ads are sold according to the number of times the ad appears (the <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_5c"><a class="glossterm">impression</a><span class="glossdef">Each time an advertisement is displayed.</span></span>). Ad rates are quoted in <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_6a"><a class="glossterm">CPM</a><span class="glossdef">Cost per thousand impressions (the M representing the roman numeral for one thousand).</span></span>, meaning cost per thousand impressions (the M representing the roman numeral for one thousand). Display ads sold on a CPM basis are often used as part of branding campaigns targeted more at creating awareness than generating click-throughs. Such techniques often work best for promoting products like soft drinks, toothpaste, or movies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cost-per-action (CPA)</a><span class="glossdef">A method of charging for advertising whenever a user performs a specified action such as signing up for a service, requesting material, or making a purchase.</span></span> ads pay whenever a user clicks through and performs a specified action such as signing up for a service, requesting material, or making a purchase. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Affiliate programs</a><span class="glossdef">A cost-per-action program, where program sponsors (e.g., Amazon.com, iTunes) pay referring Web sites a percentage of revenue earned from the referral.</span></span> are a form of cost-per-action, where vendors share a percentage of revenue with Web sites that direct purchasing customers to their online storefronts. Amazon runs the world’s largest affiliate program, and referring sites can earn 4 percent to 15 percent of sales generated from these click-throughs. Purists might not consider affiliate programs as advertising (rather than text or banner ads, Amazon’s affiliates offer links and product descriptions that point back to Amazon’s Web site), but these programs can be important tools in a firm’s promotional arsenal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p05">And rather than buying targeted ads, a firm might sometimes opt to become an exclusive advertiser on a site. For example, a firm could buy access to all ads served on a site’s main page; it could secure exclusive access to a region of the page (such as the topmost banner ad); or it may pay to sponsor a particular portion or activity on a Web site (say a parenting forum, or a “click-to-print” button). Such deals can be billed based on a flat rate, CPM, CPC, or any combination of metrics.</p>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Ads in Games?</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p06">As consumers spend more time in video games, it’s only natural that these products become ad channels, too. Finding a way to introduce ads without eroding the game experience can be a challenge. Advertising can work in racing or other sports games (in 2008 the Obama campaign famously ran virtual billboards in EA’s Burnout Paradise), but ads make less sense for games set in the past, future, or on other worlds. Branding ads often work best since click-throughs are typically not something you want disrupting your gaming experience.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p07">Advertisers have also explored sponsorships of Web-based and mobile games. Sponsorships often work best with casual games, such as those offered on Yahoo! Games or EA’s Pogo. Firms have also created online mini games (so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advergames</a><span class="glossdef"></span></span>) for longer term, immersive brand engagement (e.g., Mini Cooper’s Slide Parking and Stride Gum’s Chew Challenge). Others have tried a sort of virtual product placement integrated into experiences. A version of The Sims, for example, included virtual replicas of real-world inventory from IKEA and H&amp;M. And Zynga has done a variety of in-game promotions that include work with Lady Gaga in Farmville and CityVille promotions of Kung Fu Panda 2.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p08">In-game ad-serving technology also lacks the widely accepted standards of Web-based ads, so it’s unlikely that ads designed for a Wii sports game could translate into a PS3 first-person shooter.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_p09">In-game advertising shows promise, but the medium is considerably more complicated than conventional Web site ads. That complexity lowers relative ROI and will likely continue to constrain growth. As a sign of the difficulty in the space, consider that in 2010 Microsoft shuttered its in-game advertising unit, Massive, just four years after acquiring the firm for an estimated $200 million to $400 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_085">M.

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s06_l02">
            <li>Web ad formats include, but are not limited to, the following: <em class="emphasis">image</em> (or <em class="emphasis">display</em>) <em class="emphasis">ads</em> (such as horizontally oriented <em class="emphasis">banners</em>, smaller rectangular <em class="emphasis">buttons</em>, and vertically oriented <em class="emphasis">skyscraper ads</em>), <em class="emphasis">rich media ads</em> (which can include animation or video), and <em class="emphasis">interstitials</em> (ads that run before a user arrives at a Web site’s contents).</li>
            <li>In addition to cost-per-click, ads can be sold based on the number of times the ad appears (impressions), whenever a user performs a specified action such as signing up for a service, requesting material, or making a purchase (cost-per-action), or on an exclusive basis which may be billed at a flat rate.</li>
            <li>In-game advertising shows promise, with successful branding campaigns run as part of sports games, through in-game product placement, or via sponsorship of casual games, or in brand-focused advergames.</li>
            <li>A lack of standards, concerns regarding compatibility with gameplay, and the cost of developing and distributing games are all stifling the growth of in-game ads.</li>
