            <li>Identify the environmental threats that Zara is likely to face, and consider options available to the firm for addressing these threats.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p02">The holy grail for the strategist is to craft a sustainable competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to replicate. And for nearly two decades Zara has delivered the goods. But that’s not to say the firm is done facing challenges.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p03">Consider the limitations of Zara’s Spain-centric, just-in-time manufacturing model. By moving all of the firm’s deliveries through just two locations, both in Spain, the firm remains hostage to anything that could create a disruption in the region. Firms often hedge risks that could shut down operations—think weather, natural disaster, terrorism, labor strife, or political unrest—by spreading facilities throughout the globe. If problems occur in northern Spain, Zara has no such fallback.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p04">In addition to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">operations</a><span class="glossdef">The organizational activities that are required to produce goods or services. Operations activities can involve the development, execution, control, maintenance, and improvement of an organization’s service and manufacturing procedures.</span></span> vulnerabilities above, the model also leaves the firm potentially more susceptible to financial vulnerabilities during periods when the euro strengthens relative to the dollar. Many low-cost manufacturing regions have currencies that are either pegged to the dollar or have otherwise fallen against the euro. This situation means Zara’s Spain-centric costs rise at higher rates compared to competitors, presenting a challenge in keeping profit margins in check. Rising transportation costs are another concern. If fuel costs rise, the model of twice-weekly deliveries that has been key to defining the Zara experience becomes more expensive to maintain.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p05">Still, Zara is able to make up for some cost increases by raising prices overseas (in the United States, Zara items can cost 40 percent or more than they do in Spain). Zara reports that all North American stores are profitable, and that it can continue to grow its presence, serving forty to fifty stores with just two U.S. jet flights a week.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_043">J. Tagliabue, “A Rival to Gap That Operates Like Dell,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 30, 2003.</span> Management has considered a logistics center in Asia, but expects current capacity will suffice until 2013.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_044">C. Rohwedder and K. Johnson, “Pace-Setting Zara Seeks More Speed to Fight Its Rising Cheap-Chic Rivals,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 20, 2008.</span> Another possibility might be a center in the Maquiladora region of northern Mexico, which could serve the U.S. markets via trucking capacity similar to the firm’s Spain-based access to Europe, while also providing a regional center to serve expansion throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p06">Rivals have studied the Zara recipe, and while none have attained the efficiency  of Amancio Ortega’s firm, many are  trying to learn from the master. There is precedent for contract firms closing the cycle time gap with vertically integrated competitors that own their own factories. Dell (a firm that builds its own PCs while nearly all its competitors use contract labor) has seen its manufacturing advantage from vertical integration fall as the partners that supply rivals have mimicked its techniques and have become far more efficient.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_045">T. Friscia, K. O’Marah, D. Hofman, and J. Souza, “The AMR Research Supply Chain Top 25 for 2009,” <em class="emphasis">AMR Research</em>, May 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.amrresearch.com/Content/View.aspx?compURI=tcm:7-43469">http://www.amrresearch.com/Content/View.aspx?compURI=tcm:7-43469</a>.</span>   In terms of the number of new models offered, clothing is actually more complex than computing, suggesting that Zara’s value chain may be more difficult to copy. Still, H&amp;M has increased the frequency of new items in stores, Forever 21 and Uniqlo get new looks within six weeks, and Renner, a Brazilian fast fashion rival, rolls out mini collections every two months.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_046">M. Pfeifer, “Fast and Furious,” <em class="emphasis">Latin Trade</em>, September 2007; and C. Rohwedder and K. Johnson, “Pace-Setting Zara Seeks More Speed to Fight Its Rising Cheap-Chic Rivals,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 20, 2008.</span>   Rivals have a keen eye on Inditex, with the CFO of luxury goods firm Burberry claiming the firm is a “fantastic case study” and “we’re mindful of their techniques.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_047">C. Rohwedder and K. Johnson, “Pace-Setting Zara Seeks More Speed to Fight Its Rising Cheap-Chic Rivals,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 20, 2008.</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p07">Finally, firm financial performance can also be impacted by broader economic conditions. When the economy falters, consumers simply buy less and may move a greater share of their wallet to less-stylish and lower-cost offerings from deep discounters like Wal-Mart. Zara is also particularly susceptible to conditions in Spain since that market accounts for nearly 40 percent of Inditex sales,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_048">J. Hall, “Zara Is Now Bigger Than Gap,” <em class="emphasis">Telegraph</em>, August 18, 2008.</span>  as well as to broader West European conditions (which with Spain make up 79 percent of sales).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_049">C. Rohwedder, “Zara Grows as Retail Rivals Struggle,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, March 26, 2009.</span>  Global expansion will provide the firm with a mix of locations that may be better able to endure downturns in any single region. Recent Spanish and European financial difficulties have made clear the need to decrease dependence on sales within one region.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch01_s03_p08">Zara’s winning formula can only exist through management’s savvy understanding of how information systems can enable winning strategies (many tech initiatives were led by José Maria Castellano, a “technophile” business professor who became Ortega’s right-hand man in the 1980s).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn01_050">C. Rohwedder and K. Johnson, “Pace-Setting Zara Seeks More Speed to Fight Its Rising Cheap-Chic Rivals,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 20, 2008.</span> It is technology that helps Zara identify and manufacture the clothes customers want, get those products to market quickly, and eliminate costs related to advertising, inventory missteps, and markdowns. A strategist must always scan the state of the market as well as the state of the art in technology, looking for new opportunities and remaining aware of impending threats. With systems so highly tuned for success, it may be unwise to bet against “The Cube.”</p>
