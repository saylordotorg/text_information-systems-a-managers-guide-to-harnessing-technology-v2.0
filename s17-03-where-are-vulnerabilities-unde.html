The goal of phishing is to leverage the reputation of a trusted firm or friend to trick the victim into performing an action or revealing information. The cons are crafty. Many have masqueraded as a security alert from a bank or e-commerce site (“Our Web site has been compromised, click to log in and reset your password.”), a message from an employer, or even a notice from the government (“Click here to update needed information to receive your tax refund transfer.”). Sophisticated con artists will lift logos, mimic standard layouts, and copy official language from legitimate Web sites or prior e-mails. Gartner estimates that these sorts phishing attacks cost consumers $3.2 billion in 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_023">L. Avivah, “Phishing Attacks Escalate, Morph, and Cause Considerable Damage,” <em class="emphasis">Gartner</em>, December 12, 2007.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s03_p02">Other phishing attempts might dupe a user into unwittingly downloading dangerous software (malware) that can do things like record passwords and keystrokes, provide hackers with deeper access to your corporate network, or enlist your PC as part of a botnet. One attempt masqueraded as a message from a Facebook friend, inviting the recipient to view a video. Victims clicking the link were then told they need to install an updated version of the Adobe Flash plug-in to view the clip. The plug in was really a malware program that gave phishers control of the infected user’s computer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_024">B. Krebs, “‘Koobface’ Worm Resurfaces on Facebook, MySpace,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, March 2, 2009.</span> Other attempts have populated P2P networks (peer-to-peer file distribution systems such as BitTorrent) with malware-installing files masquerading as video games or other software, movies, songs, and pornography.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s03_p03">So-called spear phishing attacks specifically target a given organization or group of users. In one incident, employees of a medical center received e-mails purportedly from the center itself, indicating that the recipient was being laid off and offering a link to job counseling resources. The link really offered a software payload that recorded and forwarded any keystrokes on the victim’s PC.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_025">C. Garretson, “Spam that Delivers a Pink Slip,” <em class="emphasis">NetworkWorld</em>, November 1, 2006.</span> And with this type of phishing, the more you know about a user, the more convincing it is to con them. Phishers using pilfered résumé information from Monster.com crafted targeted and personalized e-mails. The request, seemingly from the job site, advised users to download the “Monster Job Seeker Tool”; this “tool” installed malware that encrypted files on the victim’s PC, leaving a ransom note demanding payment to liberate a victim’s hard disk.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_026">T.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s03_p08">Social networks and other Web 2.0 tools are a potential gold mine for crooks seeking to pull off phishing scams. Malware can send messages that seem to come from trusted “friends.” Messages such as status updates and tweets are short, and with limited background information, there are fewer contexts to question a post’s validity. Many users leverage bit.ly or other URL-shortening services that don’t reveal the Web site they link to in their URL, making it easier to hide a malicious link. While the most popular URL-shortening services maintain a blacklist, early victims are threatened by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">zero-day exploits</a><span class="glossdef">Attacks that are so new that they haven’t been clearly identified, and so they haven’t made it into security screening systems.</span></span>. Criminals have also been using a variety of techniques to spread malware across sites or otherwise make them difficult to track and catch.</p>
                <p class="para">The technical openness of many Web 2.0 efforts can also create problems if schemes aren’t implemented properly. For example, Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page fell victim to hackers who used a hole in a Facebook API that allowed unauthorized status update posts to public Facebook fan pages.<span class="footnote" id="e565.fwk-38086-fn13_081">G. Cluley, “Mark Zuckerberg Fan Page Hacked on Facebook: What Really Happened?” <em class="emphasis">NakedSecurity</em>, January 27, 2011.</span> APIs can allow firms to share services, collaborate, and enable mash-ups, but if code is poorly implemented it can also be an open back door where the bad guys can sneak in.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s03_p09">Some botnets have even used Twitter to communicate by sending out coded tweets to instruct compromised machines.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_027">UnsafeBits, “Botnets Go Public by Tweeting on Twitter,” <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em>, August 17, 2009.</span> Social media can also be a megaphone for loose lips, enabling a careless user to broadcast proprietary information to the public domain. A 2009 Congressional delegation to Iraq was supposed to have been secret. But Rep. Peter Hoekstra tweeted his final arrival into Baghdad for all to see, apparently unable to contain his excitement at receiving BlackBerry service in Iraq. Hoekstra tweeted, “Just landed in Baghdad. I believe it may be first time I’ve had bb service in Iraq. 11th trip here.” You’d think he would have known better. At the time, Hoekstra was a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee!</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Passwords</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p01">Many valuable assets are kept secure via just one thin layer of protection—the password. And if you’re like most users, your password system is a mess.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_028">F. Manjoo, “Fix Your Terrible, Insecure Passwords in Five Minutes,” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, November 12, 2009.</span> With so many destinations asking for passwords, chances are you’re using the same password (or easily guessed variants) in a way that means getting just one “key” would open many “doors.” The typical Web user has 6.5 passwords, each of which is used at four sites, on average.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_029">N. Summers, “Building a Better Password,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 19, 2009.</span> Some sites force users to change passwords regularly, but this often results in insecure compromises. Users make only minor tweaks (e.g., appending the month or year); they write passwords down (in an unlocked drawer or Post-it note attached to the monitor); or they save passwords in personal e-mail accounts or on unencrypted hard drives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p02">The challenge questions offered by many sites to automate password distribution and reset are often pitifully insecure. What’s your mother’s maiden name? What elementary school did you attend? Where were you born? All are pretty easy to guess. One IEEE study found acquaintances could correctly answer colleagues’ secret questions 28 percent of the time, and those who did not know the person still guessed right at a rate of 17 percent. Plus, within three to six months, 16 percent of study participants forgot answers to <em class="emphasis">their own</em> security questions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_030">R. Lemos, “Are Your ‘Secret Questions’ Too Easily Answered?” <em class="emphasis">Technology Review</em>, May 18, 2009.</span> In many cases, answers to these questions can be easily uncovered online. Chances are, if you’ve got an account at a site like Ancestry.com, classmates.com, or Facebook, then some of your secret answers have already been exposed—by you! A Tennessee teen hacked into Sarah Palin’s personal Yahoo! account (gov.palin@yahoo.com) in part by correctly guessing where she met her husband. A similar attack hit staffers at Twitter, resulting in the theft of hundreds of internal documents, including strategy memos, e-mails, and financial forecasts, many of which ended up embarrassingly posted online.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_031">N. Summers, “Building a Better Password,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 19, 2009.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p03">Related to the password problem are issues with system setup and configuration. Many vendors sell software with a common default password. For example, for years, leading database products came with the default account and password combination “scott/tiger.” Any firm not changing default accounts and passwords risks having an open door. Other firms are left vulnerable if users set systems for open access—say turning on file sharing permission for their PC. Programmers, take note: well-designed products come with secure default settings, require users to reset passwords at setup, and also offer strong warnings when security settings are made weaker. But unfortunately, there are a lot of legacy products out there, and not all vendors have the insight to design for out-of-the-box security.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Building a Better Password</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p04">There’s no simple answer for the password problem. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Biometrics</a><span class="glossdef">Technologies that measure and analyze human body characteristics for identification or authentication. These might include fingerprint readers, retina scanners, voice and face recognition, and more.</span></span> are often thought of as a solution, but technologies that replace conventionally typed passwords with things like fingerprint readers, facial recognition, or iris scans are still rarely used, and PCs that include such technologies are widely viewed as novelties. Says Carnegie Mellon University CyLab fellow Richard Power, “Biometrics never caught on and it never will.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_032">N. Summers, “Building a Better Password,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 19, 2009.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p05">Other approaches leverage technology that distributes single use passwords. These might arrive via external devices like an electronic wallet card, key chain fob, or cell phone. Security firm RSA has even built the technology into BlackBerrys. Enter a user name and receive a phone message with a temporary password. Even if a system was compromised by keystroke capture malware, the password is only good for one session. Lost device? A central command can disable it. This may be a good solution for situations that demand a high level of security, and Wells Fargo and PayPal are among the firms offering these types of services as an option. However, for most consumer applications, slowing down users with a two-tier authentication system would be an impractical mandate.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p06">While you await technical fixes, you can at least work to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. It’s unlikely you’ve got the memory or discipline to create separate unique passwords for all of your sites, but at least make it a priority to create separate, hard-to-guess passwords for each of your highest priority accounts (e.g., e-mail, financial Web sites, corporate network, and PC). Remember, the integrity of a password shared across Web sites isn’t just up to you. That hot start-up Web service may not have the security resources or experience to protect your special code, and if that Web site’s account is hacked, your user name and password are now in the hands of hackers that can try out those “keys” across the Web’s most popular destinations.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p07">Web sites are increasingly demanding more “secure” passwords, requiring users to create passwords at least eight characters in length and that include at least one number and other nonalphabet character. Beware of using seemingly clever techniques to disguise common words. Many commonly available brute-force password cracking tools run through dictionary guesses of common words or phrases, substituting symbols or numbers for common characters (e.g., “@” for “a,” “+” for “t”). For stronger security, experts often advise basing passwords on a phrase, where each letter makes up a letter in an acronym. For example, the phrase “My first Cadillac was a real lemon so I bought a Toyota” becomes “M1stCwarlsIbaT.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_033">F. Manjoo, “Fix Your Terrible, Insecure Passwords in Five Minutes,” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, November 12, 2009.</span> Be careful to choose an original phrase that’s known only by you and that’s easy for you to remember. Studies have shown that acronym-based passwords using song lyrics, common quotes, or movie lines are still susceptible to dictionary-style hacks that build passwords from pop-culture references (in one test, two of 144 participants made password phrases from an acronym of the Oscar Meyer wiener jingle).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_034">N.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p01">Some exploits directly target poorly designed and programmed Web sites. Consider the SQL injection technique. It zeros in on a sloppy programming practice where software developers don’t validate user input.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p02">It works like this. Imagine that you visit a Web site and are asked to enter your user ID in a field on a Web page (say your user ID is smith). A Web site may be programmed to take the data you enter from the Web page’s user ID field (smith), then add it to a database command (creating the equivalent of a command that says “find the account for ‘smith’”). The database then executes that command.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p03">But Web sites that don’t verify user entries and instead just blindly pass along entered data are vulnerable to attack. Hackers with just a rudimentary knowledge of SQL could type actual code fragments into the user ID field, appending this code to statements executed by the site (see sidebar for a more detailed description). Such modified instructions could instruct the Web site’s database software to drop (delete) tables, insert additional data, return all records in a database, or even redirect users to another Web site that will scan clients for weaknesses, then launch further attacks. Security expert Ben Schneier noted a particularly ghastly SQL injection vulnerability in the publicly facing database for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, where “anyone with basic SQL knowledge could have registered anyone he wanted as a sex offender.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_045">B. Schneier, “Oklahoma Data Leak,” <em class="emphasis">Schneier on Security</em>, April 18, 2008.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p04">Not trusting user input is a cardinal rule of programming, and most well-trained programmers know to validate user input. But there’s a lot of sloppy code out there, which hackers are all too eager to exploit. IBM identifies SQL injection as the fastest growing security threat, with over half a million attack attempts recorded each day.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_046">A. Wittmann, “The Fastest-Growing Security Threat,” <em class="emphasis">InformationWeek</em>, November 9, 2009.</span> Some vulnerable systems started life as quickly developed proofs of concepts, and programmers never went back to add the needed code to validate input and block these exploits. Other Web sites may have been designed by poorly trained developers who have moved on to other projects, by staff that have since left the firm, or where development was outsourced to another firm. As such, many firms don’t even know if they suffer from this vulnerability.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p05">SQL injection and other application weaknesses are particularly problematic because there’s not a commercial software patch or easily deployed piece of security software that can protect a firm. Instead, firms have to meticulously examine the integrity of their Web sites to see if they are vulnerable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_047">While some tools exist to automate testing, this is by no means as easy a fix as installing a commercial software patch or virus protection software.</span></p>

This includes testing new applications, existing and legacy applications, partner offerings, and SaaS (software as a service) applications—everything.

Hacking toolkits can do the same thing. While you won’t find this sort of software for sale on Amazon, a casual surfing of the online underworld (not recommended or advocated) will surface scores of tools that probe systems for the latest vulnerabilities then launch appropriate attacks. In one example, a $700 toolkit (MPack v. 86) was used to infiltrate a host of Italian Web sites, launching Trojans that infested 15,000 users in just a six-day period.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_050">“Web Threats Whitepaper,” <em class="emphasis">Trend Micro</em>, March 2008.</span>  As an industry executive in <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> has stated, “The barrier of entry is becoming so low that literally anyone can carry out these attacks.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_051">J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s01_p01">The network itself may also be a source of compromise. Recall that the TJX hack happened when a Wi-Fi access point was left open and undetected. A hacker just drove up and performed the digital equivalent of crawling through an open window. The problem is made more challenging since wireless access points are so inexpensive and easy to install. For less than $100, a user (well intentioned or not) could plug in to an access point that could provide entry for anyone. If a firm doesn’t regularly monitor its premises, its network, and its network traffic, it may fall victim.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s01_p02">Other troubling exploits have targeted the very underpinning of the Internet itself. This is the case with so-called DNS cache poisoning. The DNS, or domain name service, is a collection of software that maps an Internet address, such as (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bc.edu">http://www.bc.edu</a>), to an IP address, such as 136.167.2.220. 220 (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch14#fwk-38086-ch14" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 12 "A Manager’s Guide to the Internet and Telecommunications"</a> for more detail). DNS cache poisoning exploits can redirect this mapping and the consequences are huge. Imagine thinking that you’re visiting your bank’s Web site, but instead your network’s DNS server has been poisoned so that you really visit a carefully crafted replica that hackers use to steal your log-in credentials and drain your bank account. A DNS cache poisoning attack launched against one of China’s largest ISPs redirected users to sites that launched malware exploits, targeting weaknesses in RealPlayer, Adobe Flash, and Microsoft’s ActiveX technology, commonly used in browsers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_052">J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p01">A firm doesn’t just have to watch out for insiders or compromised software and hardware; a host of other physical threats can grease the skids to fraud, theft, and damage. Most large firms have disaster-recovery plans in place. These often include provisions to backup systems and data to off-site locales, to protect operations and provide a fall back in the case of disaster. Such plans increasingly take into account the potential impact of physical security threats such as terrorism, or vandalism, as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p02">Anything valuable that reaches the trash in a recoverable state is also a potential security breach. Hackers and spies sometimes practice <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dumpster diving</a><span class="glossdef">Combing through trash to identify valuable assets.</span></span>, sifting through trash in an effort to uncover valuable data or insights that can be stolen or used to launch a security attack. This might include hunting for discarded passwords written on Post-it notes, recovering unshredded printed user account listings, scanning e-mails or program printouts for system clues, recovering tape backups, resurrecting files from discarded hard drives, and more.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p03">Other compromises might take place via <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">shoulder surfing</a><span class="glossdef">Gaining compromising information through observation (as in looking over someone’s shoulder).</span></span>, simply looking over someone’s shoulder to glean a password or see other proprietary information that might be displayed on a worker’s screen.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p04">Firms might also fall victim to various forms of eavesdropping, such as efforts to listen into or record conversations, transmissions, or keystrokes. A device hidden inside a package might sit inside a mailroom or a worker’s physical inbox, scanning for open wireless connections, or recording and forwarding conversations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_053">J. Robertson, “Hackers Mull Physical Attacks on a Networked World,” <em class="emphasis">San Francisco Chronicle</em>, August 8, 2008.</span> Other forms of eavesdropping can be accomplished via compromised wireless or other network connections, malware keylogger or screen capture programs, as well as hardware devices such as replacement keyboards with keyloggers embedded inside, microphones to capture the slightly unique and identifiable sound of each key being pressed, programs that turn on built-in microphone or cameras that are now standard on many PCs, or even James Bond-style devices using Van Eck techniques that attempt to read monitors from afar by detecting their electromagnetic emissions.</p>

                <h3 class="title">The Encryption Prescription</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p05">During a routine physical transfer of backup media, Bank of America lost tapes containing the private information—including Social Security and credit card numbers—of hundreds of thousands of customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_054">J. Mardesich, “Ensuring the Security of Stored Data,” CIO Strategy Center, 2009.</span> This was potentially devastating fodder for identity thieves. But who cares if someone steals your files if they still can’t read the data? That’s the goal of encryption!</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Encryption</a><span class="glossdef">Scrambling data using a code or formula, known as a cipher, such that it is hidden from those who do not have the unlocking key.</span></span> scrambles data, making it essentially unreadable to any program that doesn’t have the descrambling password, known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key</a><span class="glossdef">Code that unlocks encryption.</span></span>. Simply put, the larger the key, the more difficult it is for a brute-force attack to exhaust all available combinations and crack the code. When well implemented, encryption can be the equivalent of a rock solid vault. To date, the largest known <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brute-force attacks</a><span class="glossdef">An attack that exhausts all possible password combinations in order to break into an account. The larger and more complicated a password or key, the longer a brute-force attack will take.</span></span>, demonstration hacks launched by grids of simultaneous code-cracking computers working in unison, haven’t come close to breaking the type of encryption used to scramble transmissions that most browsers use when communicating with banks and shopping sites. The problem occurs when data is nabbed before encryption or after decrypting, or in rare cases, if the encrypting key itself is compromised.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p07">Extremely sensitive data—trade secrets, passwords, credit card numbers, and employee and customer information—should be encrypted before being sent or stored.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_055">J. Mardesich, “Ensuring the Security of Stored Data,” CIO Strategy Center, 2009.</span> Deploying encryption dramatically lowers the potential damage from lost or stolen laptops, or from hardware recovered from dumpster diving. It is vital for any laptops carrying sensitive information.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p08">Encryption is also employed in virtual private network (VPN) technology, which scrambles data passed across a network. Public wireless connections pose significant security threats—they may be set up by hackers that pose as service providers, while really launching attacks on or monitoring the transmissions of unwitting users. The use of VPN software can make any passed-through packets unreadable. Contact your firm or school to find out how to set up VPN software.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p09">In the Bank of America example above, the bank was burned. It couldn’t verify that the lost tapes were encrypted, so it had to notify customers and incur the cost associated with assuming data had been breached.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn13_056">J. Mardesich, “Ensuring the Security of Stored Data,” CIO Strategy Center, 2009.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p10">Encryption is not without its downsides. Key management is a potentially costly procedural challenge for most firms. If your keys aren’t secure, it’s the equivalent of leaving the keys to a safe out in public. Encryption also requires additional processing to scramble and descramble data—drawing more power and slowing computing tasks. Moore’s Law will speed things along, but it also puts more computing power in the hands of attackers. With hacking threats on the rise, expect to see laws and compliance requirements that mandate encrypted data, standardize encryption regimes, and simplify management.</p>

                <h3 class="title">How Do Web Sites Encrypt Transmissions?</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p11">Most Web sites that deal with financial transactions (e.g., banks, online stores) secure transmissions using a method called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public key encryption</a><span class="glossdef">A two key system used for securing electronic transmissions. One key distributed publicly is used to encrypt (lock) data, but it cannot unlock data. Unlocking can only be performed with the private key. The private key also cannot be reverse engineered from the public key. By distributing public keys, but keeping the private key, Internet services can ensure transmissions to their site are secure.</span></span>. The system works with two keys—a public key and a private key. The public key can “lock” or encrypt data, but it can’t unlock it: that can only be performed by the private key. So a Web site that wants you to transmit secure information will send you a public key—you use this to lock the data, and no one that intercepts that transmission can break in unless they’ve got the private key. If the Web site does its job, it will keep the private key out of reach of all potentially prying eyes.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p12">Wondering if a Web site’s transmissions are encrypted? Look at the Web address. If it begins with “https” instead of “http”, it should be secure. Also, look for the padlock icon in the corner of your Web browser to be closed (locked). Finally, you can double click the padlock to bring up a verification of the Web site’s identity (verified by a trusted third party firm, known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">certificate authority</a><span class="glossdef">A trusted third party that provides authentication services in public key encryption schemes.</span></span>). If this matches your URL and indicates the firm you’re doing business with, then you can be pretty sure verified encryption is being used by the firm that you intend to do business with.</p>
