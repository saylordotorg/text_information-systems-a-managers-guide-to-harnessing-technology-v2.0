    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_p02">Managers are confused, and for good reason. Management theorists, consultants, and practitioners often vehemently disagree on how firms should craft tech-enabled strategy, and many widely read articles contradict one another. Headlines such as “Move First or Die” compete with “The First-Mover Disadvantage.” A leading former CEO advises, “destroy your business,” while others suggest firms focus on their “core competency” and “return to basics.” The pages of the <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> declare, “IT Doesn’t Matter,” while a <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> bestseller hails technology as the “steroids” of modern business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_p03">Theorists claiming to have mastered the secrets of strategic management are contentious and confusing. But as a manager, the ability to size up a firm’s strategic position and understand its likelihood of sustainability is one of the most valuable and yet most difficult skills to master. Layer on thinking about technology—a key enabler to nearly every modern business strategy, but also a function often thought of as easily “outsourced”—and it’s no wonder that so many firms struggle at the intersection where strategy and technology meet. The business landscape is littered with the corpses of firms killed by managers who guessed wrong.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_p04">Developing strong strategic thinking skills is a career-long pursuit—a subject that can occupy tomes of text, a roster of courses, and a lifetime of seminars. While this chapter can’t address the breadth of strategic thought, it is meant as a primer on developing the skills for strategic thinking about technology. A manager that understands issues presented in this chapter should be able to see through seemingly conflicting assertions about best practices more clearly; be better prepared to recognize opportunities and risks; and be more adept at successfully brainstorming new, tech-centric approaches to markets.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Danger of Relying on Technology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Firms strive for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sustainable competitive advantage</a><span class="glossdef">Financial performance that consistently outperforms industry averages.</span></span>, financial performance that consistently outperforms their industry peers. The goal is easy to state, but hard to achieve. The world is so dynamic, with new products and new competitors rising seemingly overnight, that truly sustainable advantage might seem like an impossibility. New competitors and copycat products create a race to cut costs, cut prices, and increase features that may benefit consumers but erode profits industry-wide. Nowhere is this balance more difficult than when competition involves technology. The fundamental strategic question in the Internet era is, “<em class="emphasis">How can I possibly compete when everyone can copy my technology and the competition is just a click away?</em>” Put that way, the pursuit of sustainable competitive advantage seems like a lost cause.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p02">But there are winners—big, consistent winners—empowered through their use of technology. How do they do it? In order to think about how to achieve sustainable advantage, it’s useful to start with two concepts defined by Michael Porter. A professor at the Harvard Business School and father of the <em class="emphasis">value chain</em> and the <em class="emphasis">five forces</em> concepts (see the sections later in this chapter), Porter is justifiably considered one of the leading strategic thinkers of our time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p03">According to Porter, the reason so many firms suffer aggressive, margin-eroding competition is because they’ve defined themselves according to operational effectiveness rather than strategic positioning. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Operational effectiveness</a><span class="glossdef">Performing the same tasks better than rivals perform them.</span></span> refers to performing the same tasks better than rivals perform them. Everyone wants to be better, but the danger in operational effectiveness is “sameness.” This risk is particularly acute in firms that rely on technology for competitiveness. After all, technology can be easily acquired. Buy the same stuff as your rivals, hire students from the same schools, copy the look and feel of competitor Web sites, reverse engineer their products, and you can match them. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fast follower problem</a><span class="glossdef">Exists when savvy rivals watch a pioneer’s efforts, learn from their successes and missteps, then enter the market quickly with a comparable or superior product at a lower cost before the first mover can dominate.</span></span> exists when savvy rivals watch a pioneer’s efforts, learn from their successes and missteps, then enter the market quickly with a comparable or superior product at a lower cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p04">Since tech can be copied so quickly, followers can be fast, indeed. Several years ago while studying the Web portal industry (Yahoo! and its competitors), a colleague and I found that when a firm introduced an innovative feature, at least one of its three major rivals would match that feature in, on average, only one and a half months.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_001">J. Gallaugher and C. Downing, “Portal Combat: An Empirical Study of Competition in the Web Portal Industry,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Information Technology Management</em> 11, no. 1—2 (2000): 13—24.</span> Groupon CEO Andrew Mason claimed the wildly successful daily deal service had spawned 500 imitators within two years of launch.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_043">B. Weiss, “Groupon’s $6 Billion Gambler,” <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, December 20, 2010.</span> When technology can be matched so quickly, it is rarely a source of competitive advantage. And this phenomenon isn’t limited to the Web.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p05">Consider TiVo. At first blush, it looks like this first mover should be a winner since it seems to have established a leading brand; TiVo is now a verb for digitally recording TV broadcasts. But despite this, TiVo has largely been a money loser, going years without posting an annual profit. By the time 1.5 million TiVos had been sold, there were over thirty million digital video recorders (DVRs) in use.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_003">N. DiMeo, “TiVo’s Goal with New DVR: Become the Google of TV,” <em class="emphasis">Morning Edition</em>, National Public Radio, April 7, 2010.</span>  Rival devices offered by cable and satellite companies appear the same to consumers and are offered along with pay television subscriptions—a critical distribution channel for reaching customers that TiVo doesn’t control.</p>
        <p class="para block">The Flip video camera is another example of technology alone offering little durable advantage. The pocket-sized video recorders used flash memory instead of magnetic storage. Flip cameras grew so popular that Cisco bought Flip parent Pure Digital, for $590 million. The problem was digital video features were easy to copy, and constantly falling technology costs (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38086-ch04#fwk-38086-ch04" xrefstyle="select: label">Chapter 5 "Moore’s Law: Fast, Cheap Computing and What It Means for the Manager"</a>) allowed rivals to embed video into their products. Later that same year Apple (and other firms) began including video capture as a feature in their music players and phones. Why carry a Flip when one pocket device can do everything? The Flip business barely lasted two years, and by spring 2011 Cisco had killed the division, taking a more than half-billion-dollar spanking in the process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_044">E. Rusli, “Cisco Shutters Flip, Two Years After Acquisition,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 12, 2011.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s01_p06">Operational effectiveness is critical. Firms must invest in techniques to improve quality, lower cost, and generate design-efficient customer experiences. But for the most part, these efforts can be matched. Because of this, operational effectiveness is usually not sufficient enough to yield sustainable dominance over the competition. In contrast to operational effectiveness, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategic positioning</a><span class="glossdef">Performing different tasks than rivals, or the same tasks in a different way.</span></span> refers to performing different activities from those of rivals, or the same activities in a different way. Technology itself is often very easy to replicate, and those assuming advantage lies in technology alone may find themselves in a profit-eroding arms race with rivals able to match their moves step by step. But while technology can be copied, technology can also play a critical role in creating and strengthening strategic <em class="emphasis">differences</em>—advantages that rivals will struggle to match.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Different Is Good: FreshDirect Redefines the NYC Grocery Landscape</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p01">For an example of the relationship between technology and strategic positioning, consider FreshDirect. The New York City–based grocery firm focused on the two most pressing problems for Big Apple shoppers: selection is limited and prices are high. Both of these problems are a function of the high cost of real estate in New York. The solution? Use technology to craft an ultraefficient model that makes an end-run around stores.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p02">The firm’s “storefront” is a Web site offering one-click menus, semiprepared specials like “meals in four minutes,” and the ability to pull up prior grocery lists for fast reorders—all features that appeal to the time-strapped Manhattanites who were the firm’s first customers. (The Web’s not the only channel to reach customers—the firm’s iPhone app was responsible for 2.5 percent of sales just weeks after launch.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_004">R. M. Schneiderman, “FreshDirect Goes to Greenwich,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, April 6, 2010.</span> Next-day deliveries are from a vast warehouse the size of five football fields located in a lower-rent industrial area of Queens. At that size, the firm can offer a fresh goods selection that’s over five times larger than local supermarkets. Area shoppers—many of whom don’t have cars or are keen to avoid the traffic-snarled streets of the city—were quick to embrace the model. The service is now so popular that apartment buildings in New York have begun to redesign common areas to include secure freezers that can accept FreshDirect deliveries, even when customers aren’t there.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_005">L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p03">The FreshDirect model crushes costs that plague traditional grocers. Worker shifts are highly efficient, avoiding the downtime lulls and busy rush hour spikes of storefronts. The result? Labor costs that are 60 percent lower than at traditional grocers. FreshDirect buys and prepares what it sells, leading to less waste, an advantage that the firm claims is “worth 5 percentage points of total revenue in terms of savings.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_006">P. Fox, “Interview with FreshDirect Co-Founder Jason Ackerman,” Bloomberg Television, June 17, 2009.</span> Overall perishable inventory at FreshDirect turns 197 times a year versus 40 times a year at traditional grocers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_007">E.

And those goods are fresher since they’ve been in stock for less time, too. Consider that while the average grocer may have seven to nine days of seafood inventory, FreshDirect’s seafood stock turns each day. Stock is typically purchased direct from the docks in order to fulfill orders placed less than twenty-four hours earlier.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_008">T. Laseter, B. Berg, and M.

The firm also uses recycled biodiesel fuel to cut down on delivery costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p05">FreshDirect buys directly from suppliers, eliminating middlemen wherever possible. The firm also offers suppliers several benefits beyond traditional grocers, all in exchange for more favorable terms. These include offering to carry a greater selection of supplier products while eliminating the “slotting fees” (payments by suppliers for prime shelf space) common in traditional retail, cobranding products to help establish and strengthen supplier brand, paying partners in days rather than weeks, and sharing data to help improve supplier sales and operations. Add all these advantages together and the firm’s big, fresh selection is offered at prices that can undercut the competition by as much as 35 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_010">H. Green, “FreshDirect,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, November 24, 2003.</span> And FreshDirect does it all with margins in the range of 20 percent (to as high as 45 percent on many semiprepared meals), easily dwarfing the razor-thin 1 percent margins earned by traditional grocers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_011">S. Sieber and J. Mitchell, “FreshDirect: Online Grocery that Actually Delivers!” <em class="emphasis">IESE Insight</em>, 2007; D.

Fox, “Interview with FreshDirect Co-Founder Jason Ackerman,” Bloomberg Television, June 17, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p06">Today, FreshDirect serves a base of some 600,000 paying customers. That’s a population roughly the size of metro-Boston, serviced by a single grocer with no physical store. The privately held firm has been solidly profitable for several years. Even in recession-plagued 2009, the firm’s CEO described 2009 earnings as “pretty spectacular,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_012">P. Fox, “Interview with FreshDirect Co-Founder Jason Ackerman,” Bloomberg Television, June 17, 2009.</span> while 2010 revenues are estimated to grow to roughly $300 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_013">R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s02_p07">Technology is critical to the FreshDirect model, but it’s the collective impact of the firm’s differences when compared to rivals, this tech-enabled strategic positioning, that delivers success. Operating for more than half a decade, the firm has also built up a set of strategic assets that not only address specific needs of a market but are now extremely difficult for any upstart to compete against. Traditional grocers can’t fully copy the firm’s delivery business because this would leave them <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">straddling</a><span class="glossdef">Attempts to occupy more than one position, while failing to match the benefits of a more efficient, singularly focused rival.</span></span> two markets (low-margin storefront and high-margin delivery), unable to gain optimal benefits from either. Entry costs for would-be competitors are also high (the firm spent over $75 million building infrastructure before it could serve a single customer), and the firm’s complex and highly customized software, which handles everything from delivery scheduling to orchestrating the preparation of thousands of recipes, continues to be refined and improved each year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_014">C. Valerio, “Interview with FreshDirect Co-Founder Jason Ackerman,” <em class="emphasis">Venture</em>, Bloomberg Television, September 18, 2009.</span> On top of all this comes years of customer data used to further refine processes, speed reorders, and make helpful recommendations. Competing against a firm with such a strong and tough-to-match strategic position can be brutal. Just five years after launch there were one-third fewer supermarkets in New York City than when FreshDirect first opened for business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_015">R.

        <h2 class="title editable block">But What Kinds of Differences?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s03_p01">The principles of operational effectiveness and strategic positioning are deceptively simple. But while Porter claims strategy is “fundamentally about being different,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_016">M. Porter, “What Is Strategy?” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 74, no. 6 (November–December 1996): 61–78.</span> how can you recognize whether your firm’s differences are special enough to yield sustainable competitive advantage?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s03_p02">An approach known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resource-based view of competitive advantage</a><span class="glossdef">The strategic thinking approach suggesting that if a firm is to maintain sustainable competitive advantage, it must control an exploitable resource, or set of resources, that have four critical characteristics. These resources must be (1) valuable, (2) rare, (3) imperfectly imitable, and (4) nonsubstitutable.</span></span> can help. The idea here is that if a firm is to maintain sustainable competitive advantage, it must control a set of exploitable resources that have four critical characteristics. These resources must be (1) <em class="emphasis">valuable</em>, (2) <em class="emphasis">rare</em>, (3) <em class="emphasis">imperfectly imitable</em> (tough to imitate), and (4) <em class="emphasis">nonsubstitutable</em>. Having all four characteristics is key. Miss value and no one cares what you’ve got. Without rareness, you don’t have something unique. If others can copy what you have, or others can replace it with a substitute, then any seemingly advantageous differences will be undercut.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s03_p03">Strategy isn’t just about recognizing opportunity and meeting demand. Resource-based thinking can help you avoid the trap of carelessly entering markets simply because growth is spotted. The telecommunications industry learned this lesson in a very hard and painful way. With the explosion of the Internet it was easy to see that demand to transport Web pages, e-mails, MP3s, video, and everything else you can turn into ones and zeros, was skyrocketing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s03_p04">Most of what travels over the Internet is transferred over long-haul  fiber-optic cables, so telecom firms began digging up the ground and  laying webs of fiberglass to meet the growing demand. Problems resulted  because firms laying long-haul fiber didn’t fully appreciate that their  rivals and new upstart firms were doing the exact same thing. By one  estimate there was enough fiber laid to stretch from the Earth to the  moon some 280 times!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_017">L. Kahney, “Net Speed Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet,” <em class="emphasis">Wired News</em>, March 21, 2000.</span>  On top of that, a technology called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)</a><span class="glossdef">A technology that increases the transmission capacity (and hence speed) of fiber-optic cable.

The end result—these new assets weren’t rare and each day they seemed to  be less valuable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch02_s01_s03_p05">For some firms, the transmission prices they charged on newly laid cable collapsed by over 90 percent. Established firms struggled, upstarts went under, and WorldCom became the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The impact was also felt throughout all industries that supplied the telecom industry. Firms like Sun, Lucent, and Nortel, whose sales growth relied on big sales to telecom carriers, saw their value tumble as orders dried up. Estimates suggest that the telecommunications industry lost nearly $4 trillion in value in just three years,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn02_018">L. Endlich, <em class="emphasis">Optical Illusions: Lucent and the Crash of Telecom</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004).</span> much of it due to executives that placed big bets on resources that weren’t strategic.</p>
