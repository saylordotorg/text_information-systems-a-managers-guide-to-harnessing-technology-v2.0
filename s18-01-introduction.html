    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p02">Google has been called a one-trick pony,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_001">C. Li, “Why Google’s One-Trick Pony Struggles to Learn New Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Publishing</em>, May 2009.</span> but as tricks go, it’s got an exquisite one. Google’s “trick” is matchmaking—pairing Internet surfers with advertisers and taking a cut along the way. This cut is substantial—about $29 billion in 2010. In fact, as <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>’s Steve Levy puts it, Google’s matchmaking capabilities may represent “the most successful business idea in history.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_002">S. Levy, “The Secrets of Googlenomics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 2009.</span> For perspective, consider that as a ten-year-old firm, and one that had been public for less than five years, Google had already grown to earn more annual advertising dollars than <em class="emphasis">any</em> U.S. media company. No television network, no magazine group, no newspaper chain brings in more ad bucks than Google. And none is more profitable. While Google’s stated mission is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” advertising drives profits and lets the firm offer most of its services for free.</p>

Not bad for a business started by two twenty-something computer science graduate students. By 2007 that duo, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were billionaires, tying for fifth on the <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> 400 list of wealthiest Americans. And by 2010 Google had become one of the twenty most profitable firms in the United States, the youngest firm by far on the list.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher_1.2-5061-20111010-134035-817369">While the bulk of the firm’s revenues come from advertising, the firm is now clearly engaged in a wide-ranging multi-front war that includes mobile, browsers, cloud infrastructure, email, office apps, social media, maps, tablets, television, video, and more. And while the firm’s performance in each space varies, the success of its existing businesses provides a massive cash horde that allows the firm to fuel experimentation, constantly innovate, tolerate failure, acquire aggressively, and patiently build new markets.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p05">Brin and Page have built a talent magnet.

The Googleplex is also pretty green. The facility gets 30 percent of its energy from solar cells, representing the largest corporate installation of its kind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_008">D.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p06">The firm’s quirky tech-centric culture is evident everywhere. A T-Rex skeleton looms near the volleyball court. Hanging from the lobby ceiling is a replica of SpaceShipOne, the first commercial space vehicle. And visitors to the bathroom will find “testing on the toilet,” coding problems or other brainteasers to keep gray matter humming while seated on one of the firm’s $800 remote-controlled Japanese commodes. Staff also enjoy an A-list lecture series attracting luminaries ranging from celebrities to heads of state.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p07">And of course there’s the food—all of it free. The firm’s founders felt that no employee should be more than 100 feet away from nourishment, and a tour around Google offices will find espresso bars, snack nooks, and fully stocked beverage refrigerators galore. There are eleven gourmet cafeterias on-site, the most famous being “Charlie’s Place,” first run by the former executive chef for the Grateful Dead.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p08">Chairman and former CEO Eric Schmidt said the goal of all this is “to strip away everything that gets in our employees’ way.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_009">L.

The Googleplex is like a well-fed Manhattan project, and employee ranks have included a gaggle of geniuses that helped invent critical technologies such as the Macintosh user interface, the python programming language, the XML standard, and even the protocols that underlie the Internet itself.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38086-ch08_s01_p09">Engineers find Google a particularly attractive place to work, in part due to a corporate policy of offering “20 percent time,” the ability to work the equivalent of one day a week on new projects that interest them. It’s a policy that has fueled innovation. Google Vice President Marissa Mayer (who herself regularly ranks among <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s most powerful women in business) has stated that roughly half of Google products got their start in 20 percent time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn08_010">B.
