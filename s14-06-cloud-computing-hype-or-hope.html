    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_p02">Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, lamenting the buzzword-chasing character of the tech sector, once complained that the computer industry is more fashion-focused than even the women’s clothing business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_040">D. Farber, “Oracle’s Ellison Nails Cloud Computing,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, September 26, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13953_3-10052188-80.html?tag=mncol;txt">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13953_3-10052188-80.html?tag=mncol;txt</a>.</span> Ellison has a point: when a technology term becomes fashionable, the industry hype machine shifts into overdrive. The technology attracts press attention, customer interest, and vendor marketing teams scramble to label their products and services as part of that innovation. Recently, few tech trends have been more fashionable than <em class="emphasis">cloud computing</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_p03">Like Web 2.0, trying to nail down an exact definition for cloud computing is tough. In fact, it’s been quite a spectacle watching industry execs struggle to clarify the concept. HP’s Chief Strategy Office “politely refused” when asked by <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> to define the term cloud computing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_041">S. Hamm, “Cloud Computing: Eyes on the Skies,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, April 24, 2008.</span> Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation said about cloud computing, “It’s worse than stupidity. It’s a marketing hype campaign.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_042">L. McKay, “30,000-Foot Views of the Cloud,” <em class="emphasis">Customer Relationship Management</em>, January 2009.</span> And Larry Ellison, always ready with a sound bite, offered up this priceless quip, “Maybe I’m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It’s complete gibberish. It’s insane.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_043">D. Lyons, “A Mostly Cloudy Computing Forecast,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, November 4, 2008.</span> Insane, maybe, but also big bucks. The various businesses that fall under the rubric of cloud computing had already grown from an estimated $36 billion market in 2008 to $68 billion in 2010, accounting for over 13 percent of global software sales!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38086-fn10_044">M. Liedtke, “Cloud Computing: Pie in the Sky Concept or the Next Big Breakthrough on Tech Horizon?” <em class="emphasis">Associated Press Newswires</em>, December 21, 2008; A. Gonsalves, “Cloud Services Top $68 Billion in 2010,” <em class="emphasis">InformationWeek</em>, June 22, 2010.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_p04">When folks talk about cloud computing they’re really talking about replacing computing resources—either an organization’s or an individual’s hardware or software—with <em class="emphasis">services</em> provided over the Internet. The name actually comes from the popular industry convention of drawing the Internet or other computer network as a big cloud.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_p05">Cloud computing encompasses a bunch of different efforts. We’ll concentrate on describing, providing examples, and analyzing the managerial implications of two separate categories of cloud computing: (1) <em class="emphasis">software as a service (SaaS)</em>, where a firm subscribes to a third-party software-replacing service that is delivered online, and (2) models often referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">utility computing</a><span class="glossdef">A form of cloud computing where a firm develops its own software, and then runs it over the Internet on a service provider’s computers.</span></span>, which can include variants such as platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Using these latter techniques, an organization develops its own systems, but runs them over the Internet on someone else’s hardware. A later section on virtualization will discuss how some organizations are developing their own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">private clouds</a><span class="glossdef">Pools of computing resources that reside inside an organization and that can be served up for specific tasks as need arrives.</span></span>, pools of computing resources that reside inside an organization and that can be served up for specific tasks as need arrives.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_p06">The benefits and risks of SaaS and the utility computing-style efforts are very similar, but understanding the nuances of each effort can help you figure out if and when the cloud makes sense for your organization. The evolution of cloud computing also has huge implications across the industry: from the financial future of hardware and software firms, to cost structure and innovativeness of adopting organizations, to the skill sets likely to be most valued by employers.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-38086-ch10_s06_l02">
            <li>Cloud computing is difficult to define. Managers and techies use the term cloud computing to describe computing services provided over a network, most often commercial services provided over the Internet by a third party that can replace or offload tasks that would otherwise run on a user or organization’s existing hardware or software.</li>
            <li>Software as a service (SaaS) refers to a third-party software-replacing service that is delivered online.</li>
            <li>Hardware cloud computing services replace hardware that a firm might otherwise purchase.</li>
            <li>Estimated to be a thirty-six-billion-dollar industry, cloud computing is reshaping software, hardware, and service markets, and is impacting competitive dynamics across industries.</li>
